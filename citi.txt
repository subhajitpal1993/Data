2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Citi’s Value Proposition:

A Mission of Enabling Growth and Progress

What You Can Expect From Us & What We Expect From Ourselves
Citi’s mission is to serve as a trusted partner to our
clients by responsibly providing financial services
that enable growth and economic progress. Our
core activities are safeguarding assets, lending
money, making payments and accessing the
capital markets on behalf of our clients. We have
200 years of experience helping our clients meet
the world’s toughest challenges and embrace its
greatest opportunities. We are Citi, the global
bank — an institution connecting millions of people
across hundreds of countries and cities.
We protect people’s savings and help them make
the purchases — from everyday transactions to
buying a home — that improve the quality of their
lives. We advise people on how to invest for future
needs, such as their children’s education and their
own retirement, and help them buy securities such
as stocks and bonds.
We work with companies to optimize their daily
operations, whether they need working capital,
to make payroll or export their goods overseas.

By lending to companies large and small, we help
them grow, creating jobs and real economic value
at home and in communities around the world.
We provide financing and support to governments
at all levels, so they can build sustainable
infrastructure, such as housing, transportation,
schools and other vital public works.
These capabilities create an obligation to act
responsibly, do everything possible to create the
best outcomes, and prudently manage risk. If we
fall short, we will take decisive action and learn
from our experience.
We strive to earn and maintain the public’s trust
by constantly adhering to the highest ethical
standards. We ask our colleagues to ensure that
their decisions pass three tests: they are in our
clients’ interests, create economic value, and are
always systemically responsible. When we do these
things well, we make a positive financial and social
impact in the communities we serve and show what
a global bank can do.

Letter
To Shareholders

In 2018, we did each of those things
while demonstrating our ability to
navigate a complex environment, which
swung from a start marked by positive
sentiment driven by U.S. tax reform and
synchronized global growth to a close
when markets declined with a volatility
and velocity rarely seen. After a fourth
quarter marked by concerns about the
business cycle, trade with China and the
impact of Federal Reserve interest rate
policy, our continued progress in 2018
provided welcome assurance that our
people, model and global franchise are
resilient in challenging markets.
Across our firm we drove growth, as
we said we would do, by deepening
relationships with current clients while
also attracting new ones.

Michael L. Corbat
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2018 was a year of steady and meaningful
progress for Citi toward the overarching goal we
laid out at our Investor Day in 2017: to improve
the returns we generate on shareholders’
capital through 2020 and beyond. On that
day, we also outlined our strategy to meet
that commitment. We would drive sustainable,
client-led revenue growth by deepening our
relationships with current clients and capturing
new ones in target segments. We would use
our scale and technology to enhance our
capabilities while lowering our cost to serve
clients. We would optimize our capital base,
including returning all capital above what we
need to prudently operate and invest in the
firm. Finally, we would continue to focus on our
controls and risk management to ensure Citi is
an indisputably strong and stable institution.
2

In our Global Consumer Bank, we used
our scale and technology to make it
easier for our clients to seamlessly
bank with us, through their channel
of choice. In our U.S. franchise, our
enhanced mobile app now gives clients
a comprehensive view of their finances
and, in an industry first, gives nonCiti clients those same capabilities.
In Mexico, our redesigned mobile app
is driving double-digit user growth.
We are leveraging our experience
in Asia, where we have high digital
engagement and a growing digital
lending platform.
In our Institutional Clients Group, we
upgraded our capabilities to focus fully
on providing clients with solutions,
not products. Our Treasury and Trade
Solutions business offers the industry’s
most versatile and powerful suite of
digital platforms, tools and analytics.
A prime example is the launch of Citi
Smart Match®, created in partnership
with fintech firm HighRadius, which
uses artificial intelligence and machine
learning to enable our corporate
clients to automate the matching of
open invoices to payments.
But we’re not stopping there. Across
Citi, we’re continuously innovating
to enhance our value proposition
and accelerate our speed to market.
We’re streamlining client onboarding,
providing more personalized offers,
creating more intuitive and convenient
self-service platforms, and taking
pain points out of our processes.
These actions lowered our cost to
serve clients and enabled us to fund
investments in areas that position us
for future growth. In the second half

of 2018, efficiency savings outpaced
our incremental investments by about
$200 million, an amount we expect
to grow into the $500 million–$600
million range in both 2019 and 2020.

and Capital-Markets Origination
divisions into a new unit, Banking,
Capital Markets and Advisory, we’re
providing clients with access to a
broader range of creative solutions
across our institutional platform.
We’re also seeing the fruits of greater
connectivity between our Treasury and
Trade Solutions and foreign exchange
businesses. Above all, we’re giving
ourselves an opportunity to take a
broader, deeper, more holistic view of
our clients and their evolving needs.

We also made structural changes
across the franchise to drive growth
and boost returns.
In our largest Consumer market — the
U.S. — we created a more effective
client-centric structure that unifies
the leadership and strategy of our
Branded Card and Retail Banking
businesses, consistent with our
consumer franchises in Asia and
Mexico. Our franchise should not only
attract new clients but also enable
us to convert a larger proportion of
our more than 28 million Branded
Card clients into multi-relationship
customers. As many of our current
Card clients reside beyond our six-city
retail branch footprint, we believe
we can broaden these relationships
by providing unique and compelling
value propositions, combined with our
industry-leading digital capabilities
and nationwide ATM network.

All of those actions supported our
strategy and contributed to our
business performance in 2018. The
$18 billion of net income we earned
was 14% higher than in 2017, excluding
the one-time impact of Tax Reform in
both periods.1 On the same basis, our
earnings per share increased 25%
to $6.65 per share, driven by higher
net income and the benefit of share
repurchases. And we continued to
make progress on our efficiency ratio,
driving it down to approximately 57%
for the year after lowering our expense
base to just under $42 billion.
Perhaps most significantly, our Return
on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE),
increased to 10.9%2, surpassing our
target of at least 10.5% for the year
as we work toward our goal of at least
13.5% for 2020.

In our Institutional Clients Group,
we also made structural changes
to further enhance our clients’
experience. By combining our

Our performance on the Federal

are on track to meet our goal, subject
to regulatory approval, of returning at
least $60 billion of capital through the
three CCAR cycles ending in 2020.
In the Global Consumer Bank and
the Institutional Clients Group, we
generated underlying revenue growth
of 3%, excluding the impact of gains
on sale in both periods.3 In our Global
Consumer Bank, we realized the
benefits of investments we made
over the past several years in areas of
growth, including U.S. Branded Cards;
Retail Services, aided by the acquisition
of the L.L.Bean portfolio; and Mexico,
where we’re gaining market share and
accelerating our digital transformation.
In Asia, we saw healthy inflows of assets
under management and good growth in
the number of Citigold clients, despite
the uncertain macro environment that
impacted investment revenues.

In the Institutional Clients Group,
volatility and uncertainty at the
end of the year adversely impacted
our market-sensitive businesses,
including Fixed Income and Investment
Banking, although we grew share
and revenues in M&A Advisory and
Equities for the year. Our steady
accrual businesses — Treasury and
Trade Solutions, Securities Services,
the Private Bank and Corporate
Lending — grew revenues by 9% for
the year. Our backbone Treasury and

itself by growing revenues for the fifth
consecutive year in constant dollars.
And despite concerns about trade
rhetoric and tariffs, our global network
— one that is hard to see replicated in
the current environment — showed it
is well-positioned to capture flows no
matter where they shift.

Our bankers also served clients with
distinction, advising on some of the
biggest deals of the year. A sampling
includes NEX Group’s merger with
CME Group, advising Time Warner on
its acquisition by AT&T, serving as joint
financial advisor to Ant Financial on
the largest capital raise by a private
company, and Nestlé Holdings on its
first U.S. dollar private placement.
The trust, satisfaction and loyalty
we’re building with Citi clients are
also words that come to mind when
I think about my Citi colleagues
worldwide. They express how I feel
about a number of close colleagues
and friends of the firm who chose
2018 either to retire or embark on an
exciting new phase of their life. I won’t
name them all, but I will note the
important transition we announced
in the fall, when, after nearly seven
years as Chairman and a decade on
our Board of Directors, Michael O’Neill
retired. We are enormously grateful to
Michael O’Neill for making Citi’s Board
and our firm stronger, better, more
diverse and more capable.
The Board elected John C. Dugan as the
next Chair. In doing so, we maintained
our model of having a Non-Executive
Chair, which is in keeping with leading
corporate governance practices. John
is a former Comptroller of the Currency,
distinguished counselor and longtime
industry leader. Having been a Board
member since 2017 and an advisor to
the Board before that, he knows our firm
well and has hit the ground running.

Franz Humer and Anthony Santomero
will also retire in 2019, having reached
the retirement age for Citi Directors.
Tony has been on the Board since
2009 and chaired the Citibank Board
and the Risk Management Committee.
Franz has been on the Board since 2012
and chaired the Ethics and Culture
Committee. We thank both of them for
their years of service.
We also thank and congratulate several
senior members of my management
team on their retirement, including
our Chief Financial Officer, John
Gerspach, who is being succeeded by
longtime Citi executive Mark Mason.
Each of these talented executives
will be missed, yet we’re excited to
welcome a new group of executives
into leadership positions at Citi, where
I am sure they will shine.
In 2018, we also decided, on a number
of occasions, that there are times when
a company must take a stand. One of
those times came in January, when
in keeping with our commitment to

diversity and inclusion, we were the first
financial services firm to voluntarily
disclose our adjusted pay gap between
women and men in the U.S., the U.K.
and Germany and between minorities
and non-minorities in the U.S. We found
that women were paid on average 99%
of what men were paid and minorities
were paid on average 99% of what nonminorities were paid, and we made pay
adjustments to help close the gaps. We
viewed this as a first step on the road
toward greater pay equity transparency.
In February, I signed the CEO Action
for Diversity & Inclusion, joining
more than 350 CEOs and presidents
committed to driving policy changes
and practices in our own firms that
advance equitable workplaces. Over
the summer, my management team
and I announced representation
goals aimed at increasing the number
of black colleagues in the U.S. and
female colleagues globally in senior
positions at our firm.

At the end of the day, what matters most
to me is that every Citi colleague feels
pride in who they are and that Citi stands
with them. In my experience, having a
diverse team of people around the table
with different thoughts, insights and
perspectives leads to better decisions.
In March, in the wake of the tragic
school shooting in Parkland, Florida,
and the epidemic of gun violence in
the U.S., we were the first bank to
announce a Commercial Firearms
Policy. It requires our retail sector
clients to use established best
practices, including background checks
and age restrictions. We’re under no
illusion that any policy is a perfect
solution, but we — and I — couldn’t feel
more strongly that it’s up to companies
like ours to do more when we can.
Throughout the year, our colleagues
demonstrated their commitment to
the communities we serve. In June,
we brought more than 100,000 Citi
volunteers, alumni, clients, friends
and families in over 450 cities in 90
countries and territories to work on
more than 1,400 service projects in
their communities. It was our largest
Global Community Day ever. From
feeding hungry people to revitalizing
schools, our people showed the
positive impact our company makes
in the communities we serve.
The hard work of thousands of Citi
colleagues has created a culture of
which we can be proud. It’s a culture
based on a foundation of ethics and
execution, informed by our mission
of enabling growth and economic
progress around the world.
These efforts are among the reasons
Euromoney named Citi “Best Bank
for Corporate Social Responsibility.”
I couldn’t have said it better myself
than the editors did: “The focus on
improving economies for everyone is
something that runs deep at Citi.”
That focus is reflected in our
Sustainable Progress initiative, under
which we recorded $95 billion of
transactions toward our 10-year,
$100 billion environmental finance
goal. It is a goal we are going to reach
almost five years ahead of schedule.

Citi Announced a Global, Mission-Led Partnership
with the International Paralympic Committee
“Citi and the IPC are ideal partners because we share a deep
passion for helping to foster a more diverse and inclusive
society. These athletes have overcome adversity to achieve
the world’s most elite level of sporting excellence. Their
strength, perseverance and determination is truly what
makes them exceptional, and we look forward to supporting
their journey to compete on the global stage.”
— CEO Michael Corbat
The 18 National Paralympic
Committees Citi will sponsor
include Australia, Chinese Taipei,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Great Britain,
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria,
Philippines, Poland, Singapore,
South Africa, Thailand and the UAE.

The international partnership will run through
2020 and includes support for National Paralympic
Committees in 18 countries as they prepare for
upcoming World and regional Championships,
as well as the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.
Through the partnership, Citi aims to raise
awareness for the Paralympic Movement, support
Para athletes, and advocate for societal change in
perceptions around disability.
That focus also informed the Citi
Foundation’s partnership with the
International Rescue Committee to
invest in training and placement for
young refugees in Nigeria, Jordan
and Greece. That partnership is
part of our $100 million commitment
through Pathways to Progress to
help 500,000 young people globally
to access economic opportunity
through the workforce.
We entered 2019 with determination
and focus. We have articulated our
goals and have the resources to meet
them. While the macroeconomic picture
requires flexibility, we are prepared for a
range of operating environments.

We will remain true to our mission of
enabling growth and progress and will
continue to be true to our values as we
serve our clients. As we have shown
in 2018, our targets are achievable
and we are committed to continuing
to make steady progress toward them
every day throughout 2019.
Sincerely,

Michael L. Corbat
Chief Executive Officer, Citigroup Inc.

Global Consumer Banking
Citi’s Global Consumer Bank (GCB), a global digital
banking leader in credit cards, wealth management
and commercial banking, serves more than 110
million clients in 19 countries.

In digital, GCB’s mobile user base grew
rapidly, up 26% globally. Industryleading capabilities, redesigned
mobile experiences and market-first
partnerships with leading digital
and social platforms drove greater
engagement, higher client satisfaction
and new sources of growth. In the U.S.,
Citi announced its strategic intent
to serve retail clients nationwide. In
Mexico, our redesigned mobile app is
driving double-digit user growth and
the highest app store ratings in our
history, while Asia continues to lead on
digital partnerships and ecosystems.
With a mobile first strategic focus, we
are proud to have been recognized
by Global Finance magazine with two
global awards: Best Consumer Mobile
Bank and World’s Best Digital Bank.
Critically, Citi continued to improve
its overall control environment by
introducing new digital monitoring
and reporting capabilities; simplifying,
streamlining and standardizing its
processes and procedures; resolving
several legacy issues; and driving
accountability across the organization.

With a strategic focus in the U.S., Mexico and Asia, the Global Consumer Bank’s
segment-driven, client-led growth strategy continues to deliver solid results.
In 2018, the Global Consumer Bank strengthened its client-centric model,
rapidly accelerated its digital transformation, gained momentum resolving
legacy regulatory issues and continued to pace strategic investments in key
growth areas.
GCB strengthened its client-centric model with a reorganization that created
a regional structure in the U.S., similar to our franchises in Asia and Mexico,
and brought together product leadership globally to unify strategy across
products, segments and investments. In doing so, we are bringing together
the full power of our franchise across Citi-branded products and client
segments in the U.S., our largest market and opportunity, and driving greater
value for clients and synergies across the franchise.

Citi Retail Services’ partnership with
this iconic American lifestyle brand
enables cardmembers to explore
their passion for the outdoors with
the advanced technologies that let
them pay when, how and wherever
their adventures take them through
worldwide acceptance.

Internationally, Citi launched a redesigned mobile app and introduced enhanced
mobile features in Asia Pacific, including mobile lending on Cards, a first for Citi
globally. With mobile lending, clients can, for example, convert purchases into
installment payments directly on the app. We also made further progress on our
partnership, data and open banking/API strategy in the region. Citi was the first
to launch full-fledged API partnerships in Hong Kong, introducing a total of nine
such partnerships in the year. Using APIs, we launched a pilot with our regional
Bancassurance partner AIA in Malaysia, enabling secure real-time connectivity
between Citi and AIA’s platforms. We also launched several digital partnerships,
including a partnership with Spotify allowing Citi customers in Asia to Pay with

Citi continued to provide a range of
products, services and leading digital
capabilities to its individual, small
business and wealth management
clients. The Access Account, a checkless
bank account with no or low monthly
fees, no overdraft fees, ability to link to
a savings account, and access to Citi’s
digital, retail and ATM channels, is one of
Citibank’s fastest-growing products.
In addition to convenience and simplicity,
the account is a unique offering that
allows customers to waive a monthly
service fee in one of three easy ways,
providing customers greater control over
their finances. Introduced in 2014, the
account addresses the needs of a range
of customers, particularly first-time and
younger consumers, as well as often
overlooked portions of the U.S. market,
including low-income individuals, senior
citizens and immigrants, by reducing
the risks of overdrawn accounts and
coinciding fees.
Across the U.S., Citi continued
to finance the growth of small
businesses, through retail bank and
small business credit card lending,

as well as supply chain financing
through its institutional bank. In 2018,
Citi invested more than $11.6 billion
in small business lending in the U.S.
and also financed over $6 billion in
affordable housing projects.
Through its Citigold®, Citigold Private
Client and Citi Priority client offerings,
Citi provides institutional grade,
personalized wealth management
services, including dedicated bankers,
fund access and a range of exclusive
privileges, preferred pricing and
benefits to clients around the globe.
Over the past two years, Citi has
intensified its focus on enhancing our
Citigold wealth management offering
and deepening relationships with its
existing wealth management clients
in the six priority markets where it
has a physical presence, leveraging
our success in Asia. In 2018, growth in
Citigold households increased more
than 18% year-over-year, and Citi
continued to enhance its network of
Citigold Wealth Centers, opening its
first in San Francisco.
We continue to introduce new digital
capabilities, enabling our customers
to bank anytime, anywhere, on their
channel of choice, which is increasingly
mobile. In the U.S., we rolled out a set
of enhanced capabilities in our mobile
app on iOS, including the ability for
customers to view and analyze their
full financial position across Citi and
other banks and, in an industry first,
opened the app to non-Citi customers
to use as well. We also rolled out an
enhanced account opening and deposit
capture capability through mobile
channels on iOS.

Citi Showcases Technology Talent at Grace Hopper
Celebration

In 2018, 100 female technologists from Citi joined
more than 20,000 attendees from all over the world
at the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), the world’s
largest gathering of women technologists, produced
by AnitaB.org. Citi’s investment at GHC demonstrates
our focus and commitment to diversity and
career advancement for women in technology.
GHC is an inspiring event, in part because of the caliber and passion of the
speakers, many of whom are industry pioneers. The year’s speakers included
Priscilla Chan, co-founder of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Poet of Code
Joy Buolamwini and Professor Anita Hill. Citi’s Yasaman Hadjibashi, Head of
Data and Analytics in Citi’s Global Consumer Bank, was selected to present
ways companies can use big data for social good.
The gathering is an opportunity to experience the latest innovations from
top companies, keep skills up to date and expand one’s network. Featured
programming ranged from workplace diversity and effective management
coaching to non-traditional paths into a tech career and the role humans
play in the evolution of machine learning.
After GHC concluded, inspired attendees kept the celebratory spirit alive
throughout the year by encouraging colleagues to volunteer for new
opportunities and to continuously learn.

issues, as well as education programs
supporting efforts to breaking down the
barriers which are keeping 130 million girls
globally out of school and helping them gain
access to a quality education.

environmental solutions in partnership
with our clients, which will help address
climate change and benefit society.
For example, Citi recently issued its
first green bond, €1 billion 3-year fixed
rate notes, which will fund renewable
energy, sustainable transportation,
water quality and conservation, energy
efficiency and green building projects
financed as part of the $100 Billion
Environmental Finance Goal. The bond
and the $100 Billion Goal contribute to
our efforts to help achieve the SDGs.
Citi was a founding member of the
Green Bonds Principles and has been
a leading arranger and underwriter in

the green bonds market, helping our
clients finance sustainability initiatives
with innovative green and sustainability
bond structures. Our role supporting
and evolving this burgeoning market
is just one reflection of our ongoing
efforts to incorporate sustainability
into our business.
Our inaugural green bond was truly a
collaborative effort across the firm, as
teams from Treasury, Capital Markets,
Legal, Environmental and Social
Risk Management, Sustainability and
ICG and Corporate Communications
worked together on this important step
in our journey. As we move forward,

these teams will collectively engage
with businesses across the company to
identity even more projects that could
meet our green bond criteria.
We have also made significant progress
toward our ambitious goal to source
renewable power for 100% of our
global energy needs by 2020, with 62%
renewable energy under contract.

Citizenship

Jobs and the Next Generation
Citi and the Citi Foundation are
committed to preparing young people
for today’s competitive and rapidly
changing job market through our
Pathways to Progress initiative.
Through its three-year, $100 million
global commitment, the Foundation
aims to increase youth employment
by partnering with community
organizations and municipal leaders
to connect 500,000 low-income youth
around the world to jobs, internships,
business and leadership training by
2020. Citi is also leveraging the time
and talents of 10,000 Citi employee
volunteers to serve as mentors and
coaches and provide career guidance
to help young people move toward
their goals.
Together with our nonprofit partners
across the globe, we have reached
more than 400,000 young people
and helped them gain employability
skills and connect to new or first
job opportunities.
Over 7,000 Citi employees have
volunteered to support the economic
aspirations of young people globally by
directly sharing their time and talent.
In 2018, the Citi Foundation applied
the lessons of Pathways to Progress
to provide adult job seekers in the U.S.
the full range of services needed for
long-term employment. While prevalent
among young people, the skills gap
is also causing unemployment and
underemployment among adults.
In 2018, the Foundation provided a
$10 million grant to the Local
Initiatives Support Corporation’s

initiative to help connect unemployed
and underemployed Americans
to jobs in growth industries that
need trained workers, including
healthcare, transportation, technology,
construction and other industries
facing a shortage of skilled workers.
Through an expanded network of
sites across the U.S., job seekers have
access to a range of services designed
to increase their income, improve
their credit and raise their standard of
living. In addition to skills training and
career development, services include
personal finance coaching, continuing
education courses to strengthen math
and reading skills, and resources to
help job seekers secure child care and
housing arrangements.
Many of the new sites are located in
areas that have been designated as an
Opportunity Zone, a federal incentive
to increase investments in low-wealth
communities as part of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017.

Sustainable Cities
Local governments and community
organizations are often on the front
line of complex challenges like strained
infrastructure, affordable housing
shortages and unemployment,
particularly in low-income areas. But
local leaders, in both the public and
nonprofit sectors, are continually
facing budget and resource shortages.
Increased collaboration and investment
in innovative, efficient solutions can
help address old problems in new ways.
Some of these efforts include
supporting integral parts of a thriving
community, including small businesses
and affordable housing. In 2018, Citi
invested more than $11 billion in small
business lending in the U.S. We also
financed over $4.7 billion in affordable
housing projects during the year.
Since 2014, the City Accelerator, an
initiative of the Citi Foundation and
Living Cities, has gathered municipal
leaders from cities of all sizes to share
learnings and try new approaches for

sustainable and equitable urban growth.
For example, recognizing an opportunity
to rethink existing procurement
processes, the city of Charlotte
launched AMP UP Charlotte, a sevenmonth, in-person technical assistance
program for minority business owners
seeking city contracts. And the city of
Milwaukee worked to build awareness of
contracting opportunities and inclusion
programs after a survey of small and
minority-owned businesses revealed a
lack of awareness.
In 2018, five more U.S. cities were
included in the initiative — Atlanta,
El Paso, Long Beach, Newark and
Rochester — bringing the total to
22 cities since the program’s inception.
Through Living Cities, these five cities
are working together on projects that
support the growth of local minorityowned businesses and, in their
communities, recognizing untapped
potential and creating high-quality jobs.
Citi and the Citi Foundation also
work with community organizations
to amplify their impact. Through the
Community Progress Makers Fund,
the Citi Foundation is helping to
build vibrant, sustainable cities that
offer economic opportunities for
low-income residents. Based on the
success of those first 40 participating
organizations, we renewed the Fund
and announced 40 new grantees in
2018. To date, Community Progress
Makers has helped more than 31,700
low-income people secure financial
assets, placed more than 11,500 people
in affordable housing, strengthened
over 1,300 small businesses and
connected over 2,600 people to new
jobs in their communities.

Implementing the TCFD Recommendations
Urgent action is needed to reduce
global warming and mitigate
the potential impacts of climate
change. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change Special
Report, Global Warming of 1.5°C,
and the U.S. Fourth National
Climate Assessment warn that
the impacts and costs of climate
change are already affecting
many industries and regions and
are expected to grow as the world
continues to warm.

Finance for a
Climate-Resilient Future
Citi’s TCFD Report

Citi continues to support the Paris Agreement and was an early supporter of
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which promotes
greater understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities through
better climate disclosures. Our adoption of the TCFD recommendations builds
on over two decades of work promoting sustainability. Climate change is a
central focus of Citi’s Sustainable Progress Strategy and we take action through
strong governance, environmental financing, consideration of climate risks
in environmental and social risk management, and transparent reporting on
climate-related metrics and targets.
To pilot climate scenario analysis, one of the TCFD’s key recommendations,
Citi worked jointly with 15 other banks and the UN Environment Finance
Initiative to develop new methodologies and tools for the assessment
of transition and physical risks and opportunities within banks’ lending
portfolios. Citi piloted the transition risk methodology on our North American
oil and gas exploration and production portfolio and the transition and
physical risk methodologies on our U.S. utilities portfolio. We shared our
process and findings in our first climate disclosure report, Finance for a
Climate-Resilient Future, published in November 2018. We are proud to be the
first major U.S. bank to issue a TCFD report. By voluntarily adopting the TCFD
framework, Citi is working to better understand our own climate risks and help
navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

SMALL-SCALE
TEA FARMER,
LARGE-SCALE DREAMS.
Thirteen percent of the world’s tea exports are grown by over 600,000 small-scale tea
farmers in Kenya. Until recently, they were paid in a variety of inefficient ways, causing
delays and errors that made it hard for them to plan ahead.
The Kenya Tea Development Agency, which represents the farmers, turned to Citi for help.
Thanks to its global scale and innovative technology solutions, Citi was able to deliver fast
and reliable mobile payments. Now KTDA farmers can count on a steady flow of cash to buy
supplies, pay school fees and medical expenses, and prepare for their family’s future.
For over 200 years, Citi has enabled growth and progress for people and communities around the world.

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City Bank of New York
in 1812.
Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company whose
businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions
with a broad, yet focused, range of financial products and services, including

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2018 Summary Results

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, compared
to a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, in the prior year. Results
in 2017 included a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, related
to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which
impacted the tax line within Corporate/Other, as well as the tax lines in
North America GCB and ICG. Results in 2018 included a one-time benefit
of $94 million, due to the finalization of the provisional component of the
impact based on Citi’s analysis as well as additional guidance received from
the U.S. Treasury Department related to Tax Reform, which impacted the tax
line within Corporate/Other (for additional information, see “Significant
Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below).
Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both the current and
prior year, Citigroup net income of $18.0 billion increased 14% compared to
the prior year, reflecting a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues and lower
expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. On this basis, earnings per
share increased 25%, due to growth in net income and the 8% reduction in
average shares outstanding, driven by the common stock repurchases. (Citi’s
results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform are non-GAAP
financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations
excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both the current and
prior year provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying
fundamentals of its businesses.)
Citigroup revenues of $72.9 billion in 2018 increased 1%, as 3% growth
in GCB and 1% growth in ICG were largely offset by a 33% decrease in
Corporate/Other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
Results in 2017 included a one-time gain (approximately $580 million)
on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in ICG, and results in 2018
included a one-time gain (approximately $250 million) on the sale of an
asset management business in Latin America GCB. Excluding the gains on
sale in both periods, aggregate revenues in ICG and GCB grew 3% from the
prior year.
Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 3% to $684 billion versus the
prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S.
dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period
loans grew 4%, as 8% growth in ICG and 3% growth in GCB were partially
offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
(Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and FX
translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation
of its results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and FX
translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying
fundamentals of its businesses.)
Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.0 trillion versus the
prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s deposits were
up 7%, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in ICG and a 1% increase in GCB.

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi made steady
progress in 2018 toward improving its profitability and returns, despite a
more challenging revenue environment, particularly in certain marketsensitive businesses and given macroeconomic uncertainties. During 2018,
Citi reported 3% underlying revenue growth in Global Consumer Banking
(GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG), excluding the impact of gains
on sale in 2018 and 2017 (see “Citigroup” below). Citi had solid revenue
growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank, securities services,
equity markets and corporate lending in ICG, partially offset by weakness in
fixed income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting. Citi reported
revenue growth in all regions in GCB, reflecting continued loan and overall
deposit growth, partially offset by the near-term impact of weak market
sentiment on Asia wealth management revenues, as well as the impact from
partnership renewal terms that went into effect in 2018 in Citi-branded cards
in North America GCB.
Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in a 1% decrease
in expenses, as well as positive operating leverage, even as Citi continued to
make ongoing investments. Citi’s positive operating leverage, combined with
continued credit discipline, resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings.
Citi also generated continued loan and deposit growth during the year.
Moreover, Citi continued to return capital to its shareholders. In 2018,
Citi returned $18.4 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and
dividends. Citi repurchased over 200 million shares during the last year,
resulting in an 8% reduction in outstanding common shares. While Citi
made continued progress in returning capital to shareholders, each of Citi’s
key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see “Capital” below).
Going into 2019, while global economic growth has continued and the
underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there
continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties
that could create a more volatile operating environment and impact Citi’s
businesses and future results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks
and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations
and financial condition during 2019, see each respective business’s results
of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. Despite
these risks and uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress
made during 2018 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to
benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and
economic conditions as they develop.

Expenses
Citigroup operating expenses of $41.8 billion decreased 1% versus the
prior year, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets more
than offset the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing
investments. Operating expenses in both ICG and GCB were up 3%, while
Corporate/Other operating expenses declined 40%, all versus the prior year.

of partnership renewal terms. Citi retail services revenues of $6.6 billion
increased 3% versus the prior year, primarily reflecting organic loan growth
and the benefit of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition, partially offset by higher
partner payments. Retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year
to $5.3 billion. Excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of
$4.8 billion were up 6% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in
deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes.
North America GCB average deposits of $180 billion decreased a
net 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market
balances, as clients transferred money to investments. North America GCB
average retail loans of $56 billion grew 1% from the prior year. Assets under
management of $60 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as
5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due
to the equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. Average Citi-branded card
loans of $88 billion increased 4%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of
$344 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. Average Citi retail services
loans of $48 billion increased 6% versus the prior year, while Citi retail
services purchase sales of $87 billion were up 7%. For additional information
on the results of operations of North America GCB for 2018, see “Global
Consumer Banking—North America GCB” below.
International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and Asia
GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries))
increased 5% versus the prior year to $13.2 billion. Excluding the impact
of FX translation, international GCB revenues increased 6% versus the
prior year. Latin America GCB revenues increased 13% versus the prior
year, including the gain on sale in 2018. Excluding the gain on sale, Latin
America GCB revenues increased 8%, driven by growth in loans and deposits
as well as improved deposit spreads. Asia GCB revenues increased 2%
versus the prior year, as continued growth in deposit, cards and insurance
revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues due to weak
market sentiment. For additional information on the results of operations
of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB for 2018, including the impact of FX
translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin America GCB” and
“Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” below.
Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of $127 billion
increased 4%, average retail loans of $90 billion increased 3%, assets under
management of $98 billion decreased 1%, average card loans of $24 billion
increased 2% and card purchase sales of $104 billion increased 7%, all
excluding the impact of FX translation.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of
$7.6 billion increased 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net loan loss
reserve builds and higher net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build of
$354 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $266 million in the
prior year. The increase largely reflected a modest net loan loss reserve build
in ICG, compared to a net loan loss reserve release in the prior year, partially
offset by lower net loan loss reserve builds in North America GCB.
Net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 1% versus the prior year.
Consumer net credit losses increased 4% to $6.9 billion, largely reflecting
volume growth and seasoning in the North America cards portfolios,
partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/
Other. Corporate net credit losses decreased 55% to $169 million, primarily
reflecting the impact of an episodic charge-off incurred in the prior year.
For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit
costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business’s results of
operations and “Credit Risk” below.
Capital
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were
11.9% and 13.5% as of December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to 12.4%
and 14.1% as of December 31, 2017, both based on the Basel III Standardized
Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. The decline in regulatory
capital largely reflected the return of capital to common shareholders,
partially offset by earnings growth. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio
as of December 31, 2018 was 6.4%, compared to 6.7% as of December 31,
2017. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related
components, see “Capital Resources” below.
Global Consumer Banking
GCB net income of $5.8 billion increased 49%. Excluding the one-time
impact of Tax Reform in the prior year, GCB net income increased 25%,
driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially
offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses were $18.6 billion, up 3%, as
higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially
offset by efficiency savings.
GCB revenues of $33.8 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, driven
by growth across all regions. North America GCB revenues increased 1% to
$20.5 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. Citi-branded
cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 1% versus the prior year, as growth in
interest-earning balances was largely offset by the previously disclosed impact

7

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $12.2 billion increased 35%. Excluding the one-time
impact of Tax Reform in the prior year, ICG net income increased 11%,
driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset
by higher operating expenses and higher cost of credit. ICG operating
expenses increased 3% to $21.0 billion, as higher compensation costs,
volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by
efficiency savings.
ICG revenues were $37.0 billion in 2018, up 1% from the prior year, as
a 6% increase in Banking revenues was largely offset by a 3% decrease in
Markets and securities services, including the impact of the gain on sale
in the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, revenues
increased 3%, primarily driven by a 6% increase in Banking revenues, as
Markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged versus
the prior year. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of
$45 million of gains on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to
losses of $133 million in the prior year.
Banking revenues of $19.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains
(losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 5%, driven by
solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, private bank and corporate
lending, partially offset by lower revenues in investment banking. Investment
banking revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 7% versus the prior year, as
growth in advisory was more than offset by a decline in both debt and equity
underwriting, largely reflecting lower market activity. Advisory revenues
increased 16% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 12% to
$991 million and debt underwriting revenues decreased 13% to $2.7 billion,
all versus the prior year.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.3 billion increased 8% versus
the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved deposit spreads,
with solid growth across net interest and fee income. Private bank revenues
increased 9% to $3.4 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in
investments, as well as improved deposit spreads. Corporate lending revenues
increased 26% to $2.3 billion. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on
loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 15% versus the prior year,
primarily driven by loan growth and lower hedging costs.
Markets and securities services revenues of $17.0 billion decreased 3%
from the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, Markets
and securities services revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year,
as a decline in fixed income markets revenues was offset by an increase in
both equity markets and securities services revenues. Fixed income markets
revenues of $11.6 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, driven by lower
revenues in both rates and currencies and spread products, reflecting the
more challenging environment. Equity markets revenues of $3.4 billion
increased 19% from the prior year (14% excluding an episodic loss in
derivatives in the prior year), driven by growth in derivatives and prime
finance as well as higher investor client revenue, partially offset by a modest
decline in cash equities. Securities services revenues of $2.6 billion increased
11%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. For
additional information on the results of operations of ICG for 2018, see
“Institutional Clients Group” below.

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other net income was $107 million in 2018, compared to a
net loss of $19.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding the one-time impact
of Tax Reform in both periods, Corporate/Other net income declined
92% to $13 million, largely reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower
operating expenses and lower cost of credit. Operating expenses of $2.3 billion
declined 40% from the prior year, largely reflecting the wind-down of legacy
assets, lower infrastructure costs and lower legal expenses. Corporate/Other
revenues were $2.1 billion, down 33% from the prior year, primarily
reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets. For additional
information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for 2018, see
“Corporate/Other” below.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING
Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consists of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin America (consisting of Citi’s consumer banking
business in Mexico) and Asia. GCB provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking,
and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above and “Managing Global
Risk—Consumer Credit” below). GCB is focused on its priority markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia with 2,410 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions
as of December 31, 2018. Asia GCB also includes traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products that are provided to retail customers in certain
EMEA countries. At December 31, 2018, GCB had approximately $432 billion in assets and $308 billion in deposits.
GCB’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large
urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets (including commercial banking), Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments
and geographies.

As part of its Citi retail services business, Citi issues co-brand and private
label credit card products with Sears. As previously disclosed, in October 2018,
Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and in connection with
the filing Sears has closed, or announced plans to close, additional stores.
On February 11, 2019, after bankruptcy court approval, ESL Investments,
Inc. purchased substantially all of Sears’ assets on a going concern basis,
including its credit card program agreement with Citi. The impact to Citi
retail services, from reduced new account acquisitions or lower purchase
sales, will depend in part on the magnitude and timing of additional Sears
store closures and continued customer attrition. Citi does not currently
expect that the sale of Sears to ESL will have an immediate or ongoing
material impact on Citi’s consolidated results. For additional information
on the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi’s
co-branding and private label credit card relationships, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” below.

2018 vs. 2017

Net income increased 68%, largely reflecting the impact of the $750 million
one-time, non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax
Reform in 2017 (for additional information, see “Significant Accounting
Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below). Excluding the
one-time impact of Tax Reform, net income increased 22%, driven primarily
by a lower effective tax rate due to Tax Reform, higher revenues and lower
cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
Revenues increased 1%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding mortgage revenues
(decline of 27%), retail banking revenues were up 6%, driven by continued
growth in deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes. Average
deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in
money market balances, as clients transferred money to investments. Assets
under management were largely unchanged from the prior year as 5%
underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due to the
equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. The decline in mortgage revenues
was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting
the higher interest rate environment.
Cards revenues increased 1%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased
1%, as growth in interest-earning balances, driven by maturity of recent
vintages and strength in loan balance retention, was largely offset by the
impact of previously disclosed partnership terms that went into effect in
2018. Citi sold its Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted
in a gain of approximately $150 million. This gain was offset by the loss of
operating revenue in the portfolio in 2018. Average loans increased 4% and
purchase sales increased 8%.
Citi retail services revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting organic
loan growth and the benefit of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition in
June 2018, partially offset by higher partner payments. Average loans
increased 6% and purchase sales increased 7%.
Expenses increased 4%, as volume growth and ongoing investments were
partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions decreased 3% from the prior year, driven by a lower net loan
loss reserve build, partially offset by higher net credit losses. The net loan
loss reserve build was $438 million in 2018, primarily reflecting volume
growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. This compares to a build of
$873 million in the prior year, which included $300 million related to an
increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets in Citi retail services
and a slight increase in delinquencies for the Citi-branded cards portfolio.
Net credit losses increased 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by higher net credit
losses in both Citi-branded cards (up 6% to $2.6 billion) and Citi retail
services (up 9% to $2.4 billion). The increase in the cards net credit losses
primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both portfolios.
For additional information on North America GCB’s retail banking,
including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail
services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2017 vs. 2016

Net income decreased 39% largely due to the one-time impact of Tax
Reform. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, net income
decreased 15%, due to higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially
offset by higher revenues.
Revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding mortgage revenues
(down 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth
in checking deposits, loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under
management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well
as a benefit from higher interest rates.
Cards revenues increased 3%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased
5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as
modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued
run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in
transactor and promotional balances.
Citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as loan growth was partially
offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships
within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards
portfolios in 2016.
Expenses increased 2%, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio,
higher volume-related expenses and investments as well as remediation costs
related to a CARD Act matter, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions increased 24%, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher
net loan loss reserve build.
Net credit losses increased 22%, largely driven by higher net credit losses
in both cards portfolios, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning,
as well as the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
The net loan loss reserve build was $873 million, compared to a build
of $659 million in the prior year, driven by volume growth and seasoning
in both cards portfolios, as well as the increase in net flow rates in later
delinquency buckets, primarily in Citi retail services.

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of
the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to
the reported results, see the table above.
2018 vs. 2017

2017 vs. 2016

Net income increased 58% to $928 million, reflecting higher revenues and
a lower effective tax rate as a result of Tax Reform, partially offset by higher
expenses and cost of credit.
Revenues increased 13%, including the gain on sale of an asset
management business (approximately $250 million). Excluding the gain
on sale, revenues were up 8%, driven by increases in both retail banking
and cards.
Retail banking revenues increased 14%. Excluding the gain on sale,
retail banking revenues increased 7%, driven by continued growth across
commercial loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads due to
higher interest rates. Average loans grew 3%, and average deposits grew 6%,
while assets under management declined 5%, primarily driven by market
performance during the second half of 2018. Cards revenues increased 9%,
due to continued volume growth, reflecting higher purchase sales (up 11%)
and full-rate revolving loans. Average cards loans grew 6%.
Expenses increased 8%, driven by volume growth, ongoing investment
spending and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency
savings. As previously disclosed, Citi continues to execute on its investment
plans for Citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020),
including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital
capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.
Provisions increased 2%, as higher net credit losses were largely offset
by a lower net loan loss reserve build. The increase in net credit losses was
primarily due to volume growth and seasoning in cards.
For additional information on Latin America GCB’s retail banking,
including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards portfolios, see
“Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.
For additional information on potential macroeconomic and geopolitical
challenges and other risks facing Latin America GCB, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” below.

Net income decreased 2%, primarily driven by higher credit costs and
expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher revenues in retail banking.
Retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in
volumes, including increases in average deposits (8%), average loans (6%)
and assets under management (4%), as well as improved deposit spreads,
driven by higher interest rates. Cards revenues were largely unchanged, as
continued improvement in full-rate revolving loans was offset by a higher
cost to fund non-revolving loans.
Expenses increased 3%, as ongoing investment spending and business
growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses
and an increase in the net loan loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume
growth and seasoning, as well as a Mexico earthquake-related loan loss
reserve build.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of the results

results, see the table above.
2018 vs. 2017

2017 vs. 2016

Net income increased 18%, reflecting higher revenues and a lower effective
tax rate as a result of Tax Reform, partially offset by higher cost of credit.
Revenues increased 2%, driven by higher retail banking and
cards revenues.
Retail banking revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in deposit
and insurance revenues was partially offset by lower investment revenues due
to weak market sentiment. Average deposits increased 3% and assets under
management grew 1%, while investment sales decreased 8%. Retail lending
revenues increased 1%, as volume growth in personal and commercial loans
was largely offset by lower mortgage revenues due to spread compression.
Average retail banking loans grew 3%.
Cards revenues increased 2%. Excluding the benefit of modest one-time
gains in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, driven by continued growth in
purchase sales (up 6%) and average loans (up 2%).
Expenses were largely unchanged, as volume-driven growth and ongoing
investment spending were offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions increased 17%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses
and a modest net loan loss reserve build compared to a modest net loan loss
reserve release in the prior year due to volume growth. Overall credit quality
continued to remain stable in the region.
For additional information on Asia GCB’s retail banking portfolios,
including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards portfolio, see
“Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

Net income increased 19%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of
credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
Revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and
wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail
lending revenues.
Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to higher investment
revenues, driven by improved investor sentiment, partially offset by the
repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. The lower retail lending revenues
(down 4%) reflected lower average loans (down 1%) due to the continued
optimization of the portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans.
Cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and
6% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the portfolio
acquisition in Australia, as well as modest gains related to sales of merchant
acquiring businesses in certain countries.
Expenses increased 1%, resulting from volume-driven growth and
ongoing investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in net
credit losses.

credit derivatives, realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt
securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts
and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets
held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on
deposits, is recorded as Net interest revenue.
The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of
interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices
and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence
and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions
do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally
result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions
can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair
value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may
increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit
spreads on product inventory positions.
ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring
and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country
level. ICG does not separately track the impact on total Markets revenues
of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of
product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above,
these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary
individually to manage the Markets businesses at an aggregate level.
In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly
attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including
commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the
results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory
in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic
hedging activities.
ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in
approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and
jurisdictions. At December 31, 2018, ICG had approximately $1.4 trillion of
assets and $690 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses—securities
services and issuer services—managed approximately $17.5 trillion of assets
under custody as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP
Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Banking and Markets and
securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see
“Citigroup Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional, public
sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of
wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity
sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services,
equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking
and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance
and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments
and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and
commodity products.
ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with
these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional
services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking
services and other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point
in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual
arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date
or closing of a transaction. Revenue generated from these activities is
recorded in Commissions and fees and Investment banking. Revenue
is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which
is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which
normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer
and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily
recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional
information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including
holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential
between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price
differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are
recorded in Principal transactions (for additional information on Principal
transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain

(1) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the
credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit
protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are nonGAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2018 vs. 2017

Within Markets and securities services:

Net income increased 35%, reflecting the impact of a $2.0 billion one-time,
non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform
in 2017 (for additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies
and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below). Excluding the one-time
impact of Tax Reform, net income increased 11%, driven primarily by a lower
effective tax rate as a result of Tax Reform and higher revenues, partially offset
by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.

• Fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, driven by lower revenues

• Revenues increased 1%, reflecting a 6% increase in Banking (including

the gains (losses) on loan hedges), largely offset by a 3% decrease in
Markets and securities services. Excluding the impact of a gain of
approximately $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics
business in the prior year, revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by
a 6% increase in Banking revenue, as Markets and securities services
revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. Excluding the
impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased
5%, driven by solid growth across treasury and trade solutions, private
bank and corporate lending. Excluding the gain on sale in the prior year,
Markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged, as
increases in equity markets and securities services revenues were offset by
a decrease in fixed income markets revenues. Citi expects that revenues
in its markets and investment banking businesses will likely reflect the
overall market environment during 2019.

Within Banking:

• Investment banking revenues decreased 7%, largely reflecting a decline

•

•

in market wallet and market share across debt and equity underwriting
as well as the comparison to the particularly strong performance in
the prior year. Advisory revenues increased 16%, reflecting strength in
North America, driven by gains in wallet share and increased market
activity. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 12%, primarily driven
by lower revenues in EMEA. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 13%,
primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%. Excluding the
impact of FX translation, revenues increased 9%, reflecting strength in
all regions, driven by growth across both net interest and fee income.
Revenues increased in the cash business, primarily driven by continued
growth in deposit balances and improved deposit spreads due to higher
interest rates, as well as higher transaction volumes from both new and
existing clients. The trade business experienced strong revenue growth,
as the business continued to focus on high-quality loan growth, while
spreads remained largely stable throughout the year. Average deposits
increased 6%, with growth across regions. Average trade loans increased
4%, driven by growth in EMEA and Asia.
Corporate lending revenues increased 26%. Excluding the impact of
gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 15%, driven by higher
loan volumes and lower hedging costs. Average loans increased 9% versus
the prior year.
Private bank revenues increased 9%, driven by underlying growth across
all regions, reflecting improved deposit spreads due to higher interest rates
and higher managed investment revenues.

•

in North America and Asia. The decrease in revenues was due to lower net
interest revenue (decrease of 16%), as non-interest revenues were largely
unchanged. The decline in net interest revenues was driven by rates and
currencies as well as spread products and other fixed income revenues,
mainly reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of
client activity, as well as higher funding costs, given the higher interest
rate environment.
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower
G10 rates revenues in North America, Asia and EMEA, reflecting lower
client activity given the uncertain macroenvironment and challenging
trading environment, and comparison to a strong prior year, particularly
in EMEA. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher G10 FX
revenues, particularly in EMEA, reflecting the continued benefit from the
return of volatility in FX markets as well as strong corporate and investor
client activity. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased
8%, driven by North America, primarily due to the challenging trading
environment characterized by widening spreads and lower investor
client activity.
Equity markets revenues increased 19%. Excluding an episodic loss in
derivatives of approximately $130 million related to a single client event
in the prior year, revenues increased 14%, as growth in equity derivatives
and prime finance was partially offset by lower cash equities revenues.
Excluding the episodic loss in the prior year, equity derivatives revenues
increased in all regions, driven by strong investor and corporate client
activity as well as a more favorable market environment. Principal
transaction revenues increased, partially offset by a decrease in net interest
revenue, mainly reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in
support of client activity. Prime finance revenues increased, particularly in
EMEA and Asia, reflecting growth in client balances and higher investor
client activity. Cash equities revenues decreased modestly, primarily driven
by Asia, due to a more challenging trading environment.
Securities services revenues increased 11%. Excluding the impact of
FX translation, revenues increased 13%, reflecting continued strength
in EMEA and Asia. The increase in revenues was driven by higher fee
revenues, reflecting growth in client volumes, as well as higher net interest
revenue driven by higher deposit volumes and higher interest rates.

Expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses
and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions increased $199 million, driven by a net loan loss reserve build
of $12 million (compared to a net release of $380 million in the prior year),
partially offset by a 53% decline in net credit losses. The modest net loan loss
reserve build was driven by volume-related reserve builds for both funded
loans and unfunded lending commitments, despite credit quality remaining
stable during 2018. The decline in net credit losses was largely driven by the
absence of a single client event in the fourth quarter of 2017.

wallet share and increased market activity. Advisory revenues increased
11%, equity underwriting revenues increased 69% and debt underwriting
revenues increased 13%.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%. Excluding
the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 7%, primarily due
to continued growth in transaction volumes and deposit balances
and improved spreads. Trade revenues increased modestly, driven by
steady loan growth, partially offset by an industry-wide tightening of
loan spreads.
Corporate lending revenues increased 58%. Excluding the impact of
losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 12%, driven by lower hedging
costs and the absence of a prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a
lease financing transaction.
Private bank revenues increased 14%, primarily due to higher loan
and deposit volumes, higher deposit spreads and increased managed
investments and capital markets activity.

•

volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year
from a more robust trading environment. The decline in revenues was
driven by lower net interest revenue, largely due to higher funding costs
and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.
The decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues
and commissions and fees revenues.
Rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower G10
rates and currencies revenues. Spread products and other fixed income
revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in 2017
given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities
revenues, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher
securitized markets revenues.
Equity markets revenues decreased 2%. Excluding the episodic loss in
derivatives of approximately $130 million related to a single client event
in 2017, revenues increased 3%, as continued growth in prime finance
and delta one client balances and higher investor client activity were
partially offset by lower episodic activity with corporate clients. Excluding
the episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues increased,
driven by the stronger investor client activity. Cash equities revenues were
modestly higher as well, partially offset by lower cash commissions, as
clients continued to move toward automated execution platforms across
the industry.
Securities services revenues increased 8%. Excluding the impact of the
divestiture of a private equity fund services business in 2016, revenues
increased 12%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest
revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.

Expenses increased 4%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses
and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of
$380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in 2016) and a
29% decline in net credit losses. The increase in net loan loss reserve releases
was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending
commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit
environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the
portfolio. The decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement
in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event
noted above.

CORPORATE/OTHER
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate
expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as Corporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer
loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on Corporate/Other, see “Citigroup Segments” above). At
December 31, 2018, Corporate/Other had $91 billion in assets, an increase of 17% from the prior year.

Net income was $107 million in 2018, compared to a net loss of $19.7 billion
in the prior year, primarily driven by the $19.8 billion one-time, non-cash
charge recorded in the tax line in 2017 due to the impact of Tax Reform.
Results in 2018 included the one-time benefit of $94 million in the tax
line, related to Tax Reform. For additional information, see “Significant
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below.
Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in 2018 and 2017, net
income decreased 92%, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower
expenses, lower cost of credit and tax benefits related to the reorganization
of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. The tax benefits were largely offset by the
release of a foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) from AOCI to
earnings (for additional information on the CTA release, see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).
Revenues decreased 33%, driven by the continued wind-down of
legacy assets.
Expenses decreased 40%, primarily driven by the wind-down of legacy
assets, lower infrastructure costs and lower legal expenses.
Provisions decreased $27 million to a net benefit of $202 million, primarily
due to lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve
release. Net credit losses declined 86% to $21 million, primarily reflecting
the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of
the North America mortgage portfolio. The net reserve release declined by
$96 million to $221 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the
legacy North America mortgage portfolio and divestitures.

The net loss was $19.7 billion, compared to net income of $521 million in the
prior year, primarily driven by the one-time impact of Tax Reform. Excluding
the one-time impact of Tax Reform, net income declined 69% to $168 million,
reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
Revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down
of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016.
Revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the
first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge
related to the exit of Citi’s U.S. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.
Expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and
lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in
episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the U.S. mortgage servicing
operations. Also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million
provision for remediation costs related to a CARD Act matter in 2017.
Provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million,
primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and
claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. Net credit losses
declined 66%, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity
and the continued wind-down of the North America mortgage portfolio.
The decline in the provision for benefits and claims was primarily due to lower
insurance activity. The net reserve release declined $147 million, and reflected
the continued wind-down of the legacy North America mortgage portfolio
and divestitures.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the
ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can
take many different forms, including without limitation:

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For
example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash
flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization
arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial
assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the
customers could otherwise obtain.

debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. The “Thereafter” interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2024–2098) are calculated
by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3) Purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the
termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow Citi to cancel the agreement with specified
notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless Citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4) Other liabilities reflected on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash;
legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. Also includes discretionary contributions in 2018 for Citi’s employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and post employment plans
and defined contribution plans.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to
absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital
through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital
through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred
stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans,
among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by
changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate
tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such
as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and
asset dispositions.
During 2018, Citi returned a total of $18.4 billion of capital to common
shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 212 million
common shares) and dividends.

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve
Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an
integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based
capital ratios and leverage ratios.
Risk-Based Capital Ratios
The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital
(including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and
deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized
Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted
assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which
are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational riskweighted assets. The Standardized Approach generally applies prescribed
supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a
result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches
are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized
Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are currently calculated on a generally
consistent basis under both approaches. The Standardized Approach excludes
operational risk-weighted assets.
The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all
U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).
Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation
Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi
and Citibank, a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital
buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential
impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based
capital ratio requirements. Any breach of the buffers to absorb losses during
periods of financial or economic stress would result in restrictions on
earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary
executive bonuses), with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent
to which the buffers are breached. The Federal Reserve Board last voted to
affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0%
in December 2017.
Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision”
of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires
Advanced Approaches banking organizations to calculate each of the three
risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and
Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and the
Advanced Approaches and comply with the lower of each of the resulting
risk-based capital ratios.

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup
and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with
each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable
regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy
against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate its
capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying
these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations,
centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup
Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of
Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital
structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is
integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including
oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each
entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable.
Based on Citigroup’s current regulatory capital requirements, as well
as consideration of potential future changes to the U.S. Basel III rules,
management currently believes that a targeted Common Equity Tier 1
Capital ratio of approximately 11.5% represents the amount necessary to
prudently operate and invest in Citi’s franchise, including when considering
future growth plans, capital return projections and other factors that may
impact Citi’s businesses. However, management may revise Citigroup’s
targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio in response to changing
regulatory capital requirements as well as other relevant factors.
For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress
testing exercises, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” below.

30

GSIB Surcharge
The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon
U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically
important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB
surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any
Countercyclical Capital Buffer.
Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based
on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee)
GSIB methodology, which primarily looks to five equally weighted broad
categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii)
cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability and (v) complexity. With
the exception of size, each of the other categories is composed of multiple
indicators, also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total.
A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB is required, on
an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject
to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method
1”) is based on the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology described above.
Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is
replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB’s reliance
on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates
relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking
organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2
uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average
foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges
calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of
systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which
the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1
and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2019
will be based on 2018 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s surcharge
determined under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than its
surcharge determined under method 1.
Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that
it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not
become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by
December 31, 2019 would not become effective until January 1, 2021).
However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would
be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower
surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge
calculated by December 31, 2019 would become effective January 1, 2020).

The following table sets forth Citi’s GSIB surcharge as determined under
method 1 and method 2 for 2018 and 2017:
2018

2017

Method 1

2.0%

2.0%

Method 2

3.0

3.0

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for both 2018 and 2017 was 3.0%, as
derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for
2019 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2
result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain
higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge and, as such, Citi’s GSIB surcharge
effective for 2020 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for
2021 is not expected to exceed 3.0%.
Transition Provisions
Generally, the U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year
transition provisions, with various “phase-ins” and “phase-outs.” Moreover,
the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical
Capital Buffer (currently 0%) commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016,
becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. However, with the exception
of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, which do not fully
phase-out of Tier 2 Capital until January 1, 2022, and the capital buffers
and GSIB surcharge, which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019,
all other transition provisions have occurred and were entirely reflected
in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios beginning January 1, 2018. Accordingly,
commencing with 2018, Citi is presenting a single set of regulatory capital
components and ratios, reflecting current regulatory capital standards in
effect throughout 2018. Citi previously disclosed its Basel III risk-based
capital and leverage ratios and related components reflecting Basel III
transition arrangements with respect to regulatory capital adjustments and
deductions, as well as full implementation, in Citi’s 2017 Annual Report
on Form 10-K; however, beginning January 1, 2018, that distinction is no
longer relevant.
The following chart sets forth the transitional progression from January 1,
2017 to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital
components comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Citi is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which
differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance
sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage
Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1
Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of
the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average
of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each
month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Effective
January 1, 2018, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to
maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.
Further, U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are subject to enhanced
Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary
Leverage ratio standards establish a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the
stated 3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, for a
total effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Effective January 1, 2018, if a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2.0% buffer, it will
be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent
of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive
bonus payments.

For additional information regarding the transition arrangements under
the U.S. Basel III rules, including Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital resources
reflecting Basel III transition arrangements as of December 31, 2017, see
“Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards” in Citigroup’s
2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi is also required to maintain a minimum
Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based
measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage
of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from
Tier 1 Capital.

32

Prompt Corrective Action Framework
In general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct the U.S.
banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities
of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital
thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy
as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,”
(ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly
undercapitalized,” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”
Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must
maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital,
Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%,
respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured
depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, must
maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0%, effective
January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses,
reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional
capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a
nine-quarter planning horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline,
adverse and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect
application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel
III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the
Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely.
For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic
Risks” below. For additional information on potential changes to the stress
testing component of capital planning and assessment process applicable to
Citi, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.
In addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act
Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative
evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market
conditions under several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This
program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to
how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical
set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability
of Citibank’s capital planning process.

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning
Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as
to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as
sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic
and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and
counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual
assessment includes two related programs:

Citigroup’s Capital Resources
Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,
Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.
Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital
and Total Capital ratios during 2018, inclusive of the 75% phase-in of both
the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of
which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 8.625%,
10.125% and 12.125%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive
of the 50% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the
3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity
Tier 1 Capital), were 7.25%, 8.75% and 10.75%, respectively.
Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital
and Total Capital ratio requirements during 2019, inclusive of the 2.5%
Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its
current level of 0%, as well as a 3.0% GSIB surcharge, will be 10.0%, 11.5%
and 13.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank
regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1
Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and
not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher
capital levels.
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must comply with a 4.0% minimum
Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement. Effective January 1, 2018, Citi must
also comply with an effective 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage
ratio requirement.

• The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s

•

capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital
distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases.
As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has
sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic
and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking
capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal
Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either
quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to
Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution
unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not
object to the distribution.
Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative
evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market
conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform
the Federal Reserve Board and the general public as to how Citi’s
regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of
adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board.
In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal
Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress
tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the
Federal Reserve Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under
company-developed scenarios.

(1) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio
was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.
(2) Citi’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios and related components as of December 31, 2017 are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior
to the effective date of January 1, 2018. Citi believes these ratios and the related components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress in prior periods against currently effective
regulatory capital standards.
(3) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.
(4) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.9% at December 31, 2018,
compared to 11.7% at September 30, 2018 and 12.4% at December 31,
2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to net income
of $4.3 billion as well as decreases in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by
the return of $5.8 billion of capital to common shareholders. Citi’s Common
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio declined from year-end 2017 primarily due to
a reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of
$18.4 billion capital to common shareholders, an increase in risk-weighted
assets, and adverse net movements in AOCI, partially offset by net income of
$18.0 billion in 2018.

(1) Issuance costs of $168 million and $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and
netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.
(2) Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.
(3) The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.
(4) Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.
(5) Of Citi’s $22.9 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2018, $11.9 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $11.0 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi’s
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2018 was $12.0 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $1.0 billion
of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S.
Basel III rules. Commencing on December 31, 2017, Citi’s DTAs arising from temporary differences were less than the 10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III rules and therefore not subject to deduction from Common
Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk-weighting at 250%.
(6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.
(7) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with,
covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds.
(8) 50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.
(9) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022.
(10) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in
arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the
extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to
limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(1) General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018
mainly driven by growth in corporate loans.
(2) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.
(3) Securitization exposures increased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018 due to increased exposures from new deals.
(4) OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 due to a decrease in notional amounts for bilateral trades. OTC derivatives increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to notional increases.
(5) Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, and other assets. Other exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in various other assets
subject to risk-weighting at 100% and additional DTAs arising from temporary differences, which are subject to risk-weighting at 250%.
(6) Off-balance sheet exposures decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in loan commitments.
(7) Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in positions subject to incremental risk charges. Risk levels increased during the 12 months ended December 31,
2018 primarily due to changes in exposure levels subject to Value at Risk and Stressed Value at Risk.
(8) Risk-weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors, as well as methodology
changes for standard specific risk charges.

Total Risk-Weighted Assets, end of period

(1) Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to seasonal spending for qualifying revolving (cards) exposures. Retail exposures decreased during the 12 months ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to residential mortgage loan sales and repayments.
(2) Wholesale exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in loan commitments.
(3) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.
(4) Securitization exposures increased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, due to increased exposures from new deals.
(5) OTC derivatives decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in potential future exposure and fair value.
(6) Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios.
(7) Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA.
(8) Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in positions subject to incremental risk charges. Risk levels increased during the 12 months ended December 31,
2018 primarily due to changes in exposure levels subject to Value at Risk and Stressed Value at Risk.
(9) Risk-weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors, as well as methodology
changes for standard specific risk charges.
(10) Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

Market risk-weighted assets decreased under both the Basel III
Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches primarily due
to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between
market risk factors, as well as methodology changes for standard specific risk
charges, partially offset by increases in positions subject to Value at Risk and
Stressed Value at Risk.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach
increased from year-end 2017 due to higher credit risk-weighted assets,
slightly offset by a decrease in market risk-weighted assets. The increase
in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to changes in OTC
derivative trade activity, repo-style transactions, growth in corporate loans,
securitization exposures and other exposures, partially offset by a decrease in
loan commitments.
Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches
decreased from year-end 2017 driven by lower operational and credit, as
well as market risk-weighted assets. The decrease in operational riskweighted assets was primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and
frequency. The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to a
decline in retail exposures driven by a reduction in residential mortgage loan
sales and repayments, and changes in OTC derivative trade activity, partially
offset by increases in repo-style transactions, securitization exposures and
other exposures.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.4% for the fourth quarter
of 2018, compared to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2018 and 6.7% for the
fourth quarter of 2017. The decline in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was
principally driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of
$5.8 billion of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income
of $4.3 billion. The decline in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2017 was

largely attributable to a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return
of $18.4 billion of capital to common shareholders, adverse net movements
in AOCI, as well as an increase in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to
growth in average on-balance sheet assets, partially offset by net income of
$18.0 billion.
The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and
related components as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S.
Depository Institutions
Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to
regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal
bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal
Reserve Board.
During 2018, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution,
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is subject to effective minimum Common Equity
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 75%
phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, of 6.375%, 7.875% and
9.875%, respectively. Citibank’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1

Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive of the
50% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, were 5.75%, 7.25%
and 9.25%, respectively. Citibank is required to maintain stated minimum
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of
4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.
The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets
and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted

(1) Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit
risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess
allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018. Citi believes these ratios and the related components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress in prior periods against currently
effective regulatory capital standards.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios
The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and
Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier
1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of
$1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted
assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage
Exposure (denominator), as of December 31, 2018. The information below is

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s
or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these
ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component
of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total
assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more
than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in
these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
At December 31, 2018, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer
registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net
capital rule, of $8.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by
$5.6 billion.
Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered
with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is
also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of
$20.9 billion at December 31, 2018, which exceeded the PRA’s minimum

Stress Buffer Requirements
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal that is designed to
more closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with
firms’ ongoing minimum capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules.
Specifically, the proposed rule would replace the existing Capital
Conservation Buffer, currently fixed at 2.5% under the U.S. Basel III rules,
with (i) a variable buffer known as the Stress Capital Buffer (as described
below), plus (ii) for U.S. GSIBs, the GSIB’s then-current GSIB surcharge, plus
(iii) the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, if any. These three components would
constitute the new Capital Conservation Buffer.
The Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) would be equal to the maximum decline
in a bank holding company’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the
severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test, plus planned common
stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the
planning horizon (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets)—the
so-called “dividend add-on.” The SCB would be subject to a floor of 2.5%.
In addition to the SCB, the proposed rule would establish a new Stress
Leverage Buffer requirement above the stated minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio
requirement. The Stress Leverage Buffer would be equal to the maximum
decline in a bank holding company’s Tier 1 Leverage ratio under the severely
adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test, plus planned common stock
dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning
horizon (expressed as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets).
Finally, the proposed rule would also modify certain assumptions
currently required in supervisory stress tests, including continued capital
distributions during the nine-quarter capital planning horizon and balance
sheet growth assumptions.
Under the timeline for stress testing and CCAR cycles included within
the proposed rule, the Federal Reserve Board would generally release its
calculation of each bank holding company’s SCB and Stress Leverage Buffer
by June 30 of each year.
A final rule has not yet been issued. In late 2018, senior staff at the Federal
Reserve Board indicated publicly that the proposal would not take effect until
2020 at the earliest. It was also noted that the Federal Reserve Board plans
to re-propose certain elements of the proposal to better balance the need to
preserve the dynamism of stress testing while reducing unnecessary volatility.
The potential re-proposal may also address certain other elements of the
original proposal, such as the relative timing between stress testing results
and the submission of a firm’s capital plan, the consequences of breaching
a buffer, the role and calibration of the dividend add-on, and the necessity of
the Stress Leverage Buffer.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee issued numerous
proposed and final rules on a variety of topics in 2018, as well as early 2019.
In the U.S., the most significant proposals would introduce stress buffer
requirements, as well as a new methodology for calculating risk-weighted
assets for derivative contracts. The Basel Committee, among other things,
finalized revisions to the GSIB framework as well as the minimum capital
requirements for market risk.
U.S. Banking Agencies

Regulatory Capital Treatment—Implementation
and Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses
(CECL) Methodology
In February 2019, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that provides
banking organizations an optional phase-in over a three-year period of the
“Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the
CECL methodology.
The rule is in recognition of the issuance by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board of ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses,” which will replace the current incurred loss methodology for
recognizing credit losses with the CECL methodology. The ASU will be
effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020, and will generally result in the earlier
recognition of the provision for credit losses and related allowance for credit
losses than current practice. For additional information regarding the CECL
methodology, see “Future Application of Accounting Standards” below.
Citi and Citibank plan to elect the transition provisions provided by the
rule, and will phase-in the “Day One” regulatory capital effects resulting
from adoption of the CECL methodology over the three-year period beginning
January 1, 2020.
Separately, in December 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a
statement that it plans to maintain its current framework for calculating
allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the 2020 and
2021 supervisory stress test cycles, and to evaluate appropriate future
enhancements to this framework as best practices for implementing CECL are
developed. However, banking organizations are required to incorporate CECL
into their stress testing methodologies, data, and disclosure beginning in the
cycle coinciding with their first full year of CECL adoption (2020 for Citi).

42

Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Total LossAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) Requirements
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) jointly issued a proposal that would modify the
enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards applicable to U.S. GSIBs
and their Federal Reserve Board or OCC-regulated insured depository
institution subsidiaries.
The proposed rule would replace the currently fixed 2.0% leverage buffer
requirement with a variable leverage buffer requirement equal to 50% of the
U.S. GSIB’s currently applicable GSIB surcharge. Similarly, for the regulated
insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, the
proposed rule would replace the currently fixed 6.0% threshold at which these
subsidiaries are considered to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework
with a threshold set at the stated minimum requirement of 3.0% plus 50% of
the GSIB surcharge applicable to the U.S. GSIB of which it is a subsidiary.
The proposed rule would also make corresponding modifications to
certain of the Federal Reserve Board’s TLAC requirements applicable to U.S.
GSIBs. Accordingly, under the proposed rule, each U.S. GSIB’s fixed 2.0%
leverage-based TLAC buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to 50%
of the GSIB surcharge, and the leverage component of each U.S. GSIB’s
Long-Term Debt (LTD) requirement would be revised to equal Total Leverage
Exposure multiplied by 2.5% plus 50% of the U.S. GSIB’s applicable GSIB
surcharge. For additional information about TLAC, see “Managing Global
Risk—Liquidity Risk—Long-Term Debt—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
(TLAC)” below.
If adopted as proposed, and assuming that Citi maintains a method 2
GSIB surcharge of 3.0%, Citi’s effective minimum Supplementary Leverage
ratio requirement would be reduced to 4.5%, compared to the current
5.0%. Citibank’s effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio to be
determined “well capitalized” under the PCA framework would similarly be
reduced to 4.5%, compared to the current 6.0%. Citi’s leverage-based TLAC
buffer would decrease from 2.0% to 1.5%, which would reduce Citi’s effective
minimum leverage-based TLAC requirement from 9.5% to 9.0%. Additionally,
the leverage component of Citi’s long-term debt requirement would decrease
from 4.5% to 4.0%.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection
Act, which was signed into law in 2018, directs the U.S. banking agencies to
amend the U.S. Basel III rules to exclude certain custody-related deposits
from the definition of Total Leverage Exposure for custody banks. The U.S.
banking agencies have not yet issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in
response to this particular provision of the Act, and it is currently unclear
how this may impact or interact with their proposed rulemaking from
April 2018.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk
In December 2018, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to introduce
the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) in the U.S.
SA-CCR would replace the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which is the
current methodology used to calculate risk-weighted assets for all derivative
contracts under the Standardized Approach, as well as risk-weighted assets for
derivative contracts under the Advanced Approaches in cases where internal
models are not used. Additionally, SA-CCR would replace CEM in numerous
other instances throughout the regulatory framework, including but not
limited to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, single counterparty credit
limits, and legal lending limits.
Under SA-CCR, a banking organization would calculate the exposure
amount of its derivative contracts at the netting set level. Multiple derivative
contracts would generally be considered to be under the same netting set
so long as each derivative contract is subject to the same qualifying master
netting agreement. SA-CCR also introduces the concept of hedging sets,
which would allow a banking organization to fully or partially net derivative
contracts within the same netting set that share similar risk factors. Moreover,
SA-CCR incorporates updated supervisory factors and maturity factors to
calculate the potential future exposure of a derivative contract, and provides
for improved recognition of collateral. Under the proposal, the exposure
amount of a netting set would be equal to an alpha factor of 1.4 multiplied
by the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure of the
netting set.
The effective date of the proposed rule is July 1, 2020; however, early
adoption would be permitted. If adopted as proposed, Citi’s risk-weighted
assets related to derivative contracts under the Standardized Approach are
likely to increase. The ultimate impact on Citi, however, will depend upon the
specific provisions of any final rule.
Stress Testing Requirements
The U.S. banking agencies have recently issued a number of proposals
that would modify company-run stress testing requirements to conform
with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection
Act. In October 2018, the Federal Reserve Board released a proposal that
would eliminate the mid-cycle stress test requirement for all bank holding
companies, including Citi, effective in the 2020 cycle (the proposal would
maintain the requirement to conduct an annual company-run stress test).
In January 2019, the Federal Reserve Board released a further proposal
that would eliminate the hypothetical adverse scenario from companyrun stress tests for bank holding companies, including Citi. Similarly, the
Federal Reserve Board would no longer include an adverse scenario in its
supervisory stress tests. (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released similar proposals in
December 2018.) Company-run stress tests and supervisory stress tests would
continue to include a severely adverse scenario. The proposals did not specify
a proposed effective date for the elimination of the adverse scenario.

43

Leverage Ratio Treatment of Client Cleared Derivatives
In October 2018, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document
seeking views as to whether a targeted and limited revision of the leverage
ratio exposure measure was warranted with regard to the treatment of
client cleared derivatives. In the U.S., the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio
framework and leverage ratio exposure measure are most closely aligned
with the Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Total Leverage Exposure,
respectively. Under the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio framework, the
leverage ratio exposure measure is generally not adjusted for physical or
financial collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques,
including initial margin received from clients. However, the Basel Committee
consultative document proposes two alternative treatments for client cleared
derivatives that would reduce the leverage ratio exposure measure, to varying
degrees, in recognition of the beneficial effects of margin requirements and
overcollateralization, as applicable.
One of the options under consideration would allow amounts of cash
and non-cash initial margin that are received from the client to offset the
potential future exposure of derivatives centrally cleared on the client’s
behalf. Another option would amend the currently specified treatment of
client cleared derivatives to align it with the measurement as determined per
the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty
credit risk exposures, as used for risk-based capital requirements. This option
would permit both cash and non-cash forms of initial margin and variation
margin received from the client to offset replacement cost and potential
future exposure for client cleared derivatives only.
If the U.S. agencies were to amend the Supplementary Leverage
Ratio requirements in a manner similar to either of the options under
consideration by the Basel Committee, Citi’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio
would likely benefit modestly. However, the impact from and timing of any
actions undertaken by the Basel Committee or the U.S. banking agencies in
this regard remains uncertain.

Basel Committee

Revised Assessment Framework for Global Systemically
Important Banks
In July 2018, the Basel Committee issued a final standard which revised its
framework for assessing the global systemic importance of banks, beginning
with the 2021 assessment. (For a description of the Basel Committee’s
GSIB methodology, so-called “method 1” under the U.S. Basel III rules, see
“Current Regulatory Capital Standards—GSIB Surcharge” above.)
The final standard introduces a trading volume indicator within the
substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category, accompanied by
an equivalent reduction in the current weighting of the existing underwriting
indicator. Among other revisions, the standard also expands the scope of
consolidation to include exposures of insurance subsidiaries within the size,
interconnectedness, and complexity categories.
If the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt the Basel Committee’s revisions
with respect to the U.S. GSIB framework, Citi’s estimated method 1 GSIB
surcharge would remain unchanged at 2.0%.
The Basel Committee indicated in the standard that it plans to complete
another review of the GSIB framework by 2021, at which time it will consider
alternative methodologies for the substitutability category, including the
removal of the existing cap. Citi’s estimated method 1 GSIB surcharge may
increase in the future, if the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt alternative
methodologies for the substitutability category.
Revisions to the Minimum Capital Requirements for
Market Risk
In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued a final standard that revises
the market risk capital framework—the so-called Fundamental Review of
the Trading Book, or FRTB. The final rule revises the assessment process
under the Advanced Approaches to determine whether a bank’s internal risk
management models appropriately reflect the risks of individual trading
desks, and clarifies the requirements for identification of risk factors that
are eligible for internal modeling. In addition, the risk weights for general
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk under the Standardized Approach
have been recalibrated.
If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s revised
market risk framework unchanged, Citi believes its market risk-weighted
assets could increase significantly. The ultimate impact on Citi, however, will
depend upon the specific provisions of any final rule.

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible
Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common
stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other
than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner.
TCE, tangible book value (TBV) per share and return on average TCE
are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of TCE,
TBV per share and return on average TCE provides alternate measures of
capital strength and performance that are commonly used by investors and
industry analysts.

RISK FACTORS
The following discussion sets forth what management currently believes
could be the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact
Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Other
risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or
its management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results
of operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be
considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties Citi
may face.

in the firm’s ongoing regulatory capital requirements for Standardized
Approach capital ratios. The SCB would be calculated by the FRB using its
proprietary data and modeling of each firm’s results. Accordingly, a firm’s
SCB would change annually based on the supervisory stress test results, thus
potentially resulting in year-to-year volatility in the calculation of the SCB.
For additional information on the FRB’s proposal, including calculation
of the SCB, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards
Developments” above.
Although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of, and the
ultimate impact to Citi from, these changes to the FRB’s stress testing and
CCAR regimes, these changes would likely increase the level of capital Citi is
required or elects to hold, including as part of Citi’s estimated management
buffer, thus potentially impacting the extent to which Citi is able to return
capital to shareholders.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders
Consistent with Its Capital Planning Efforts and Targets
Substantially Depends on the CCAR Process and the Results
of Regulatory Stress Tests.
Citi’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with
its capital planning efforts and targets, whether through its common stock
dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially depends,
among other things, on regulatory approval, including through the CCAR
process required by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the supervisory
stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability to return capital
also depends on Citi’s results of operations and effectiveness in managing its
level of risk-weighted assets and GSIB surcharge. Citi’s ability to accurately
predict, interpret or explain to stakeholders the outcome of the CCAR process,
and thus to address any market or investor perceptions, may be limited as
the FRB’s assessment of Citi’s capital adequacy is conducted using the FRB’s
proprietary stress test models, as well as a number of qualitative factors,
including a detailed assessment of Citi’s “capital adequacy process,” as
defined by the FRB. For additional information on Citi’s return of capital to
common shareholders in 2018 as well as the CCAR process, supervisory stress
test requirements and GSIB surcharge, see “Capital Resources—Overview”
and “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards—Stress
Testing Component of Capital Planning” above.
The FRB has stated that it expects leading capital adequacy practices
will continue to evolve and will likely be determined by the FRB each year
as a result of its cross-firm review of capital plan submissions. Similarly,
the FRB has indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its
annual stress testing requirements, several parameters of the annual stress
testing process may continue to be altered, including the severity of the stress
test scenario, the FRB modeling of Citi’s balance sheet and the addition of
components deemed important by the FRB.
Additionally, in April 2018, the FRB proposed integration of the annual
stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements.
Proposed changes to the stress testing regime include, among others,
introduction of a firm-specific “stress capital buffer” (SCB), which would
be equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s Common Equity Tier 1
Capital ratio under a severely adverse scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR
measurement period, subject to a minimum requirement of 2.5%. The
FRB proposed that the SCB would replace the capital conservation buffer

Citi, Its Management and Its Businesses Must Continually
Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing Regulatory
and Other Uncertainties and Changes in the U.S. and Globally.
Despite the adoption of final regulations in numerous areas impacting
Citi and its businesses over the past several years, Citi, its management
and its businesses continually face ongoing regulatory uncertainties and
changes, both in the U.S. and globally. While the areas of ongoing regulatory
uncertainties and changes facing Citi are too numerous to list completely,
various examples include, but are not limited to (i) uncertainties and
potential fiscal, monetary and regulatory changes arising from the U.S.
Presidential administration and Congress; (ii) potential changes to various
aspects of the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi (see the
CCAR risk factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards
Developments” above); and (iii) the terms of and other uncertainties
resulting from the U.K.’s potential exit from the European Union (EU) (see
the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor below).
Ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes make Citi’s and its
management’s long-term business, balance sheet and budget planning
difficult or subject to change. For example, the U.S. Presidential
administration has implemented and continues to discuss various changes to
certain regulatory requirements, which would require ongoing assessment by
management as to the impact to Citi, its businesses and business planning.
Business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules
or outcomes, which can change dramatically upon finalization, or upon
implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies
worldwide, and such guidance can change.
Moreover, U.S. and international regulatory initiatives have not always
been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas of
divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to the scope,
interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent or even
conflicting regulations, including within a single jurisdiction. For example,
in 2016, the European Commission proposed to introduce a new requirement
for major banking groups headquartered outside the EU (which would

46

include Citi) to establish an intermediate EU holding company where the
foreign bank has two or more institutions (broadly meaning banks, brokerdealers and similar financial firms) established in the EU. While the proposal
mirrors an existing U.S. requirement for non-U.S. banking organizations
to form U.S. intermediate holding companies, if adopted, it could lead to
additional complexity with respect to Citi’s resolution planning, capital
and liquidity allocation and efficiency in various jurisdictions. Regulatory
changes have also significantly increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs
(see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk
factor below).

Citi does not expect to be subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax
(BEAT) added by Tax Reform. However, any final BEAT regulations could
affect Citi’s decisions as to how to structure its non-U.S. operations, possibly
in a less cost-efficient manner. Further, if BEAT were to be applicable to Citi
in any given year, it could have a significantly adverse effect on both Citi’s net
income and regulatory capital.
For additional information on the impact of Tax Reform and on
Citi’s DTAs, including the FTCs, see “Significant Accounting Policies and
Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the Negative
Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, Will Be
Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable Income and by
the Provisions of and Guidance Issued in Connection with
Tax Reform.
At December 31, 2018, Citi’s net DTAs were $22.9 billion, net of a valuation
allowance of $9.3 billion, of which $11.0 billion was excluded from Citi’s
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules (for additional
information, see “Capital Resources—Components of Citigroup Capital”
above). Of the net DTAs at December 31, 2018, $6.8 billion related to
foreign tax credit carry-forwards (FTCs), net of a valuation allowance. The
carry-forward utilization period for FTCs is 10 years and represents the
most time-sensitive component of Citi’s DTAs. The FTC carry-forwards at
December 31, 2018 expire over the period of 2019-2028. Citi must utilize
any FTCs generated in the then-current year tax return prior to utilizing any
carry-forward FTCs.
The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, including FTCs, is
complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future
taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available
tax planning strategies. Citi’s ability to utilize its DTAs, including the FTC
components, will be dependent upon Citi’s ability to generate U.S. taxable
income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods. Failure to realize any
portion of the net DTAs would also have a corresponding negative impact on
Citi’s net income and financial returns.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) issued proposed
regulations in November 2018 regarding the required allocation of existing
FTC carry-forwards to the appropriate FTC baskets as redefined by Tax
Reform and the allocation of the overall domestic loss (ODL) to these FTC
baskets. An ODL allows a company to recharacterize domestic income as
income from sources outside the U.S., which enables a taxpayer to use FTC
carry-forwards and FTCs generated in future years, assuming the generation
of sufficient U.S. taxed income. If the final regulations issued by the U.S.
Treasury differ from the proposed regulations, the valuation allowance
against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards would increase or decrease, depending upon
the content of the final regulations. Citi’s net income would change by a
corresponding amount. However, a change in recognized FTC carry-forwards
would not impact Citi’s regulatory capital, given that such amounts are
already fully disallowed.

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax Laws
to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the Relevant
Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in the Payment
of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest.
Citi is subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and
municipalities, as well as the numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions in which
it operates. These tax laws are inherently complex and Citi must make
judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws, including
Tax Reform as mentioned above, to its entities, operations and businesses.
Citi’s interpretations and application of the tax laws, including with
respect to Tax Reform, withholding tax obligations and stamp and other
transactional taxes, could differ from that of the relevant governmental
taxing authority, which could result in the payment of additional taxes,
penalties or interest, which could be material.
Citi’s Continued Investments and Efficiency Initiatives May
Not Be as Successful as It Projects or Expects.
Citi continues to leverage its scale and make incremental investments
to deepen client relationships, increase revenue and lower expenses.
For example, Citi continues to make investments to enhance its digital
capabilities across the franchise, including digital platforms and mobile
and cloud architecture. Citi also has been investing in higher return
businesses, such as the U.S. cards and wealth management businesses in
Global Consumer Banking (GCB) as well as equities and other businesses
in Institutional Clients Group (ICG). Citi also continues to execute on its
investment of more than $1 billion in Citibanamex through 2020. Further,
Citi has been pursuing efficiency savings through various technology and
digital initiatives, location strategy and organizational simplification, which
are intended to self-fund Citi’s incremental investment initiatives as well as
offset growth-related expenses.
Citi’s investments and efficiency initiatives are being undertaken as
part of its overall strategy to meet operational and financial objectives
and targets, including operating efficiency and revenue and earnings
growth expectations. There is no guarantee that these or other initiatives
Citi may pursue will be as productive or effective as Citi expects, or at all.
Citi’s investment and efficiency initiatives may continue to evolve as its
business strategies and the market environment change, which could make
the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement, and limit
their effectiveness. Moreover, Citi’s ability to achieve expected returns on
its investments and costs savings depends, in part, on factors that it cannot
control, such as macroeconomic conditions, customer, client and competitor
actions and ongoing regulatory changes, among others.

A Deterioration in or Failure to Maintain Citi’s Co-Branding
or Private Label Credit Card Relationships, Including
as a Result of any Bankruptcy or Liquidation, Could
Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of Operations or
Financial Condition.
Citi has co-branding and private label relationships through its Citi-branded
cards and Citi retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and
merchants globally in the ordinary course of business whereby Citi issues
credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants. Citi’s co-branding and
private label agreements provide for shared economics between the parties
and generally have a fixed term. The five largest relationships, including
Sears, constituted an aggregate of approximately 11% of Citi’s revenues
in 2018.
These relationships could be negatively impacted by, among other
things, external factors outside the control of either party to the relationship,
such as the general economic environment, declining sales and revenues
or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant, termination
due to a contractual breach by Citi or by the retailer or merchant, or other
factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations
or other similar events. Over the last several years, a number of U.S.
retailers have continued to experience declining sales, which has resulted
in significant numbers of store closures and, in a number of cases,
bankruptcies, as retailers attempt to cut costs and reorganize. For example,
as previously disclosed, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
October 2018. On February 11, 2019, after bankruptcy court approval, ESL
Investments purchased substantially all of Sears’ assets on a going concern
basis, including its credit card program agreement with Citi (for further
information, including certain potential impacts to Citi retail services, see
“Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB” above). In addition,
as has been widely reported, competition among card issuers, including
Citi, for these relationships is significant, and it has become increasingly
difficult in recent years to maintain such relationships on the same terms
or at all. While various mitigating factors could be available to Citi if any of
these events were to occur—such as by replacing the retailer or merchant
or offering other card products—such events, particularly bankruptcies
or liquidations, could negatively impact the results of operations or
financial condition of Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services or Citi as
a whole, including as a result of loss of revenues, increased expenses,
higher cost of credit, impairment of purchased credit card relationships
and contract-related intangibles or other losses (for information on Citi’s
credit card related intangibles generally, see Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).

Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Challenges and
Uncertainties Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s
Businesses and Results of Operations.
Citi has experienced, and could experience in the future, negative impacts
to its businesses and results of operations as a result of macroeconomic and
geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatility. For example, changes
in U.S. trade policies, which have resulted in retaliatory measures from
other countries, could result in a reduction or realignment of trade flows
among countries and negatively impact businesses, sectors and economic
growth rates. Additional areas of uncertainty include, among others,
geopolitical tensions and conflicts, natural disasters, election outcomes and
other macroeconomic developments, such as those involving economic
growth rates, consumer confidence and spending, employment rates and
commodity prices.
Governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or expected actions, such
as changes in interest rate policies and any balance sheet normalization
program implemented by a central bank to reduce the size of its balance
sheet could significantly impact interest rates, economic growth rates, the
volatility of global financial markets, foreign exchange rates and capital
flows among countries. For example, in 2017, the FRB began implementing
a balance sheet normalization program to reduce the size of the central
bank’s balance sheet, although there are various uncertainties regarding the
ultimate size of the balance sheet and its composition. Such actions could,
among other things, result in higher interest rates. Although Citi estimates
its overall net interest revenue would generally increase due to higher
interest rates, higher rates could adversely affect Citi’s funding costs, levels of
deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or
product revenues.
As a result of the U.K.’s 2016 referendum on exiting the EU, numerous
uncertainties have arisen regarding the U.K.’s potential exit from and future
relationship with the EU. For example, the terms of a withdrawal continue
to be negotiated within the U.K. and between the U.K. and the EU, and it
is unclear whether the parties will be able to agree on terms prior to the
currently scheduled exit on March 29, 2019. If no agreement is reached on
terms of an exit, it could result in what is commonly referred to as a “cliffedge” or “hard” exit scenario. A hard exit scenario would result in the U.K.
and EU losing reciprocal financial services license-passporting rights and
require the U.K. to deal with the EU as a third country regime, but without an
equivalence regime or transition period in place. A hard exit scenario could
cause severe disruptions in the movement of goods and services between
the U.K. and EU countries and negatively impact financial markets and the
U.K. and EU economies. Citi’s business and operations could be impacted
by these and other factors, including the preparedness and reaction of

48

Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to Address
Any Deficiencies Identified or Guidance Provided by the
FRB and FDIC Could Subject Citi to More Stringent Capital,
Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, or Restrictions on
Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and Could Eventually
Require Citi to Divest Assets or Operations.
Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and submit a plan to the
FRB and the FDIC for the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding
company) and its significant legal entities, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
in the event of future material financial distress or failure. As previously
announced, Citi’s next resolution plan submission is due July 1, 2019. On
December 20, 2018, the FRB and FDIC issued final guidance for the 2019 and
subsequent resolution plan submissions for the eight U.S. GSIBs, including
Citi. For additional information on Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see
“Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.
Under Title I, if the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that Citi’s
resolution plan is not “credible” (which, although not defined, is generally
believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or
would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve Citi in a way that protects
systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption), or
would not facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified
deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or
liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or operations. If
within two years from the imposition of any requirements or restrictions Citi
has still not remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi could eventually
be required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such restrictions or
actions would negatively impact Citi’s reputation, market and investor
perception, operations and strategy.

clients, counterparties and financial markets infrastructure. For information
about Citi’s actions to manage the U.K.’s potential exit from the EU, see
“Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Potential Exit of U.K. from EU”
below. Further, the economic and fiscal situations of some EU countries have
remained fragile, and concerns and uncertainties remain in Europe over the
resulting effects of the U.K.’s potential exit from the EU.
These and other global macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges,
uncertainties and volatilities have negatively impacted, and could continue
to negatively impact, Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial
condition, including its credit costs, revenues in its Markets and securities
services and other businesses, and AOCI (which would in turn negatively
impact Citi’s book and tangible book value).
Citi’s Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to Various
Risks as well as Increased Compliance and Regulatory Risks
and Costs.
During 2018, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 37%
of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally defines emerging markets as countries
in Latin America, Asia (other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand),
Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Although Citi
continues to pursue its target client strategy, Citi’s presence in the emerging
markets subjects it to a number of risks, including sovereign volatility,
election outcomes, regulatory changes and political events, foreign exchange
controls, limitations on foreign investment, sociopolitical instability
(including from hyperinflation), fraud, nationalization or loss of licenses,
business restrictions, sanctions or asset freezes, potential criminal charges,
closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets. For example,
Citi operates in several countries that have, or have had in the past, strict
foreign exchange controls, such as Argentina, that limit its ability to convert
local currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside of the country.
In prior years, Citi has also discovered fraud in certain emerging markets in
which it operates. Political turmoil and instability have occurred in certain
regions and countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Latin America,
which have required management time and attention in prior years (such as
monitoring the impact of sanctions on certain emerging market economies
as well as on Citi’s businesses and results of operations in affected countries).
Citi’s emerging markets presence also increases its compliance and
regulatory risks and costs. For example, Citi’s operations in emerging
markets, including facilitating cross border transactions on behalf of its
clients, subject it to higher compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily
focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, such as anti-money
laundering regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These risks
can be more acute in less-developed markets and thus require substantial
investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction
in certain of Citi’s business activities. Any failure by Citi to comply with
applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and
markets in which it operates as a result of its global footprint, could result
in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which
could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations and reputation (see the
implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes and legal and
regulatory proceedings risk factors below).

49

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual
Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able to
Effectively Compete for Highly Qualified Employees.
Citi’s performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely
depends on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled employees. Specifically,
Citi’s continued ability to compete in its businesses, to manage its businesses
effectively and to continue to execute its overall global strategy depends on
its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing
employees. If Citi is unable to continue to attract and retain the most highly
qualified employees, Citi’s performance, including its competitive position,
the successful execution of its overall strategy and its results of operations
could be negatively impacted.
Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees depends on numerous
factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, the banking
industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of executive
and employee compensation than other industries, including deferral and
clawback requirements for incentive compensation. Citi often competes in
the market for talent with entities that are not subject to such comprehensive
regulatory requirements on the structure of incentive compensation,
including, among others, technology companies. Other factors that could
impact Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees include its culture and
the management and leadership of the Company as well as its individual
businesses, presence in the particular market or region at issue and the
professional opportunities it offers.

Uncertainties Regarding the Possible Discontinuance of the
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Any Other Interest
Rate Benchmark Could Have Adverse Consequences for Market
Participants, Including Citi.
In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) noted that market
conditions raised serious questions about the future sustainability of LIBOR
benchmarks. With the FCA securing voluntary panel bank support to sustain
LIBOR only until 2021, the future of LIBOR beyond 2021 remains uncertain.
In addition, following guidance provided by the Financial Stability Board
(FSB), other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other
benchmark rates with alternative reference rates.
Given LIBOR’s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away
from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and
institutions, including Citi. Citi’s consumer and institutional businesses
issue, trade, hold or otherwise use various products and securities that
reference LIBOR, including, among others, mortgages and other consumer
loans, commercial loans, corporate loans, various types of debt, derivatives
and other securities. If not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation
of LIBOR or any other interest rate benchmark could result in increased
financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks. For example,
a significant challenge will be the impact of LIBOR transition on contractual
mechanics of floating rate financial instruments and contracts that reference
LIBOR and mature after 2021. Certain of these instruments and contracts
do not provide for alternative reference rates. Even if the instruments and
contracts transition to alternative reference rates, the new reference rates are
likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates. While there are a number
of international working groups focused on transition plans and fallback
contract language that seek to address market disruption and value transfer,
replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark with a new benchmark rate
could adversely impact the value of and return on existing instruments
and contracts. Moreover, replacement of LIBOR or other benchmark rates
could result in market dislocations and have other adverse consequences for
market participants, including the potential for increased costs, including
by requiring Citi to pay higher interest on its obligations, and litigation
risks. For information about Citi’s management of LIBOR transition risk, see
“Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—LIBOR Transition Risk” below.

Financial Services Companies and Others as well as Emerging
Technologies Pose Increasingly Competitive Challenges to Citi.
Citi operates in an increasingly competitive environment, which includes
both financial and non-financial services firms, such as traditional banks,
online banks, financial technology companies and others. These companies
compete on the basis of, among other factors, size, quality and type of
products and services offered, price, technology and reputation. Emerging
technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate
disruption in the financial services industry. Citi competes with financial
services companies in the U.S. and globally that continue to develop and
introduce new products and services. In recent years, non-financial services
firms, such as financial technology companies, have begun to offer services
traditionally provided by financial institutions, such as Citi. These firms
attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of
companies and individuals to borrow money, save and invest. To the extent
Citi is not able to compete effectively with these and other firms, Citi could be
placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in loss of customers
and market share, and its businesses, results of operations and financial
condition could suffer. For additional information on Citi’s competitors,
see the co-brand and private label cards risk factor above and “Supervision,
Regulation and Other—Competition” below.

50

CREDIT RISKS

LIQUIDITY RISKS

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the
Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.
Credit risk arises from Citi’s lending and other businesses in both GCB
and ICG. Citi has credit exposures to counterparties in the U.S. and various
countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-of-period consumer
loans of $331 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $354 billion at
year-end 2018. A default by a borrower or counterparty, or a decline in the
credit quality or value of any underlying collateral, exposes Citi to credit risk.
Various macroeconomic, geopolitical and other factors, among other things,
can increase Citi’s credit risk and credit costs (for additional information, see
co-branding and private label credit card and macroeconomic challenges
and uncertainties risk factors above). While Citi provides reserves for
probable losses for its credit exposures, such reserves are subject to judgments
and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events
(see incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor below). For additional
information on Citi’s credit and country risk, see each respective business’
results of operations above and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” and
“Managing Global Risk—Strategic Risk—Country Risk” below and Note 14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risks, can also
increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As of year-end 2018, Citi’s most
significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and
its agencies, which primarily results from trading assets and investments
issued by the U.S. government and its agencies (for additional information,
including concentrations of credit risk to other public sector entities, see
Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi also routinely
executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign
exchange transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and with counterparties
in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies,
investment banks, governments, central banks and other financial
institutions. A rapid deterioration of a large counterparty or within a sector
or country where Citi has large exposures or unexpected market dislocations
could cause Citi to incur significant losses.

The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding Depends
on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of Citi’s
Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in Citi’s
Credit Spreads.
As a global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding
are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s liquidity and sources of funding
can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control,
such as general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental fiscal
and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative investor perceptions
of Citi’s creditworthiness, unexpected increases in cash or collateral
requirements and the inability to monetize available liquidity resources.
For example, Citi competes with other banks and financial institutions for
deposits, which represent Citi’s most stable and lowest cost of long-term
funding. The competitive environment has increased for retail banking
deposits, including as online banks and other competitors have increased
rates paid for deposits. More recently, as interest rates have increased, a
growing number of customers have transferred deposits to other products,
including investments and interest bearing accounts, and/or other financial
institutions. This, along with slower industry growth in deposits, has resulted
in a more challenging environment for deposits. In addition, as interest rates
continue to rise, financial institutions, such as Citi, may have to raise the
rates paid for deposits, thus increasing the cost of funds and affecting net
interest income and margin.
Moreover, Citi’s costs to obtain and access secured funding and long-term
unsecured funding are directly related to its credit spreads. Changes in credit
spreads constantly occur and are market driven, including both external
market factors and factors specific to Citi, and can be highly volatile. For
additional information on Citi’s primary sources of funding, see “Liquidity
Risk” below.
In addition, Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired if other
market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time,
or if market appetite is reduced, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other
market crisis. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary
or lengthier dislocation of underwriting and capital markets activity. In
addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and financial
institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise the right to require
additional collateral based on these market perceptions or market conditions,
which could further impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding.
As a holding company, Citi relies on interest, dividends, distributions and
other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy
its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries
are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other regulatory or contractual
restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local
regulatory stress test requirements. Limitations on the payments that Citi
receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity.

51

The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit
Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and Ratings
Downgrades Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Funding
and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity and
Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives Triggers That
Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral Requirements.
The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, continuously
evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citi and
its more significant subsidiaries’ long-term/senior debt and short-term/
commercial paper, as applicable, are based on a number of factors, including
standalone financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the
control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies’ proprietary rating
methodologies and assumptions, and conditions affecting the financial
services industry and markets generally.
Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current
respective ratings. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi’s ability
to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of
those funds, and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings downgrade
could also have a negative impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity due to
reduced funding capacity, as well as the impact of derivative triggers, which
could require Citi to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements. In
addition, a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on other
funding sources, such as secured financing and other margined transactions
for which there may be no explicit triggers, as well as on contractual
provisions and other credit requirements of Citi’s counterparties and clients,
which may contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold
third-party funds.
Moreover, credit ratings downgrades can have impacts that may not be
currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. For example, some
entities may have ratings limitations as to their permissible counterparties,
of which Citi may or may not be aware. Further, certain of Citi’s corporate
customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could reevaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain
contracts or market instruments with Citi in response to ratings downgrades.
Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only
Citi’s funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi
businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction
in Citi’s or Citibank’s credit ratings, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity
Risk” below.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

A Disruption of Citi’s Operational Systems Could Negatively
Impact Citi’s Reputation, Customers, Clients, Businesses or
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
A significant portion of Citi’s operations relies heavily on the secure
processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information
as well as the monitoring of a large number of complex transactions on a
minute-by-minute basis. For example, through its GCB and treasury and
trade solutions and securities services businesses in ICG, Citi obtains and
stores an extensive amount of personal and client-specific information
for its retail, corporate and governmental customers and clients and must
accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions.
With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use
of the Internet, mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial
transactions, large global financial institutions such as Citi have been, and
will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of operational disruption or
cyber or information security incidents from these activities (for additional
information on cybersecurity risk, see the discussion below). These incidents
are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources, not all of which
are in Citi’s control, including, among others, human error, fraud or malice
on the part of employees, accidental technological failure, electrical or
telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other similar
damage to Citi’s property or assets. These issues can also arise as a result of
failures by third parties with which Citi does business, such as failures by
Internet, mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors
to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent system disruptions or
cyber attacks.
Such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations
of Citi (such as the temporary loss of availability of Citi’s online banking
system or mobile banking platform), as well as the operations of its clients,
customers or other third parties. Given Citi’s global footprint and the high
volume of transactions processed by Citi, certain errors or actions may be
repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified, which
would further increase these costs and consequences. Any such events could
also result in financial losses as well as misappropriation, corruption or
loss of confidential and other information or assets, which could negatively
impact Citi’s reputation, customers, clients, businesses or results of operations
and financial condition, perhaps significantly.
Citi and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks Have
Been, and Will Continue to Be, Susceptible to an Increasing
Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated Cybersecurity
Activities That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, Misuse or
Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer Information,
Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs to Citi,
Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.
Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber
incidents such as unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including
confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of

52

service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other
similar events. These threats can arise from external parties, including
cyber criminals, cyber terrorists, hacktivists and nation state actors, as well
as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious
cyber activities.
Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other
third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, may also be sources of
cybersecurity risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s
security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources certain functions,
such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content
on customer-facing websites, and developing software for new products and
services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer
information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi websites, which could
result in compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious
code, resulting in security breaches impacting Citi customers. Furthermore,
because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected
with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including as a result of
the derivatives reforms over the last few years, Citi has increased exposure to
cyber attacks through third parties.
Citi has been subject to intentional cyber incidents from external
sources over the last several years, including (i) denial of service attacks,
which attempted to interrupt service to clients and customers, (ii) data
breaches, which obtained unauthorized access to customer account data and
(iii) malicious software attacks on client systems, which attempted to allow
unauthorized entrance to Citi’s systems under the guise of a client and the
extraction of client data. While Citi’s monitoring and protection services were
able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they
became significant, they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as
well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar
future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents
will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently and on a more
significant scale.
Further, although Citi devotes significant resources to implement,
maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with
measures such as intrusion detection and prevention and firewalls to
safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these
measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. Because the
methods used to cause cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are
not recognized until launched or even later, Citi may be unable to implement
effective preventive measures or proactively address these methods until
they are discovered. In addition, given the evolving nature of cyber threat
actors and the frequency and sophistication of cyber activities they carry out,
the determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber incident
may not occur for a substantial period until after the incident has been
discovered. Also, while Citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure
resulting from outsourcing, such as performing security control assessments
of third-party vendors and limiting third-party access to the least privileged
level necessary to perform job functions, these actions cannot prevent all
third-party related cyber attacks or data breaches.

Cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal, confidential or
proprietary customer or client information, damage to Citi’s reputation
with its clients and the market, customer dissatisfaction and additional
costs, including credit costs, to Citi, such as repairing systems, replacing
customer payment cards or adding new personnel or protection technologies.
Regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, exposure to litigation and other
financial losses, including loss of funds, to both Citi and its clients and
customers and disruption to Citi’s operational systems could also result
from cyber incidents (for additional information on the potential impact
of operational disruptions, see the operational systems risk factor above).
Moreover, the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in increased
legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms’ cybersecurity protection services
and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance protection of
consumers’ personal data.
While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms
and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain
aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover
all losses.
For additional information about Citi’s management of cybersecurity risk,
see “Managing Global Risk—Operational Risk—Cybersecurity Risk” below.
Incorrect Assumptions or Estimates in Citi’s Financial
Statements Could Cause Significant Unexpected Losses in the
Future, and Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting
Standards or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact
on How Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.
U.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions and estimates in
preparing its financial statements, including reserves related to litigation and
regulatory exposures, valuation of DTAs, the estimate of the allowance for
credit losses and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, among other
items. If Citi’s assumptions or estimates underlying its financial statements
are incorrect or differ from actual events, Citi could experience unexpected
losses, some of which could be significant.
Periodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues
financial accounting and reporting standards that may govern key aspects
of Citi’s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards
become effective, including those areas where Citi is required to make
assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB’s new accounting standard
on credit losses (CECL), which will become effective for Citi on January 1,
2020, will require earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and heldto-maturity securities and other financial assets. The CECL methodology
requires that lifetime “expected credit losses” be recorded at the time the
financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are
adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. The CECL
methodology replaces the multiple existing impairment models under U.S.
GAAP that generally require that a loss be “incurred” before it is recognized.
For additional information on this and other accounting standards,
including the expected impacts on Citi’s results of operations and financial
condition, see “Future Application of Accounting Standards” below.

53

Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations,
whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, could
present operational challenges and could require Citi to change certain of
the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial
statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its
financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to
particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which
assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements,
see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and
Notes 1 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPLIANCE RISKS

Ongoing Implementation and Interpretation of Regulatory
Changes and Requirements in the U.S. and Globally Have
Increased Citi’s Compliance Risks and Costs.
As referenced above, over the past several years, Citi has been required to
implement a significant number of regulatory changes across all of its
businesses and functions, and these changes continue. In some cases, Citi’s
implementation of a regulatory requirement is occurring simultaneously
with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance, legal challenges or
legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules.
Moreover, in many cases, these are entirely new regulatory requirements or
regimes, resulting in much uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations
as to what is definitely required in order to be in compliance. Accompanying
this compliance uncertainty is heightened regulatory scrutiny and
expectations in the U.S. and globally for the financial services industry
with respect to governance and risk management practices, including its
compliance and regulatory risks (for a discussion of heightened regulatory
expectations on “conduct risk” at, and the overall “culture” of, financial
institutions such as Citi, see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk
factor below). A failure to resolve any identified deficiencies could result
in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions. All of these factors have
resulted in increased compliance risks and costs for Citi.
Examples of regulatory changes that have resulted in increased
compliance risks and costs include (i) a proliferation of laws relating
to the limitation of cross-border data movement and/or collection and
use of customer information, including data localization and protection
and privacy laws, which also can conflict with or increase compliance
complexity with respect to other laws, including anti-money laundering
laws; and (ii) the FRB’s “total loss absorbing capacity” (TLAC) requirements,
including, among other things, consequences of a breach of the clean
holding company requirements, given there are no cure periods for
the requirements.
Extensive compliance requirements can result in increased reputational
and legal risks, as failure to comply with regulations and requirements, or
failure to comply as expected, can result in enforcement and/or regulatory
proceedings (for additional discussion, see the legal and regulatory
proceedings risk factor below). Additionally, increased and ongoing
compliance requirements and uncertainties have resulted in higher costs
for Citi. For example, Citi employed roughly 30,000 risk, regulatory and
compliance staff as of year-end 2018, out of a total employee population of
204,000, compared to approximately 14,000 as of year-end 2008 with a total
employee population of 323,000. These higher regulatory and compliance
costs can impede Citi’s ongoing, business-as-usual cost reduction efforts, and
can also require management to reallocate resources, including potentially
away from ongoing business investment initiatives, as discussed above.

Citi May Incur Significant Losses and Its Regulatory Capital
and Capital Ratios Could Be Negatively Impacted if Its Risk
Management Processes, Strategies or Models Are Deficient
or Ineffective.
Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and mitigation
processes and strategies, including the use of risk models in analyzing and
monitoring the various risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For
example, Citi uses models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives
across Citi. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, assess and manage various
risk exposures. Management of these risks is made even more challenging
within a global financial institution such as Citi, particularly given the
complex, diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in
which Citi operates as well as that losses can occur from untimely, inaccurate
or incomplete processes caused by unintentional human error.
These processes, strategies and models are inherently limited because
they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many
circumstances, assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every
economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, nor
can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Citi could
incur significant losses, and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be
negatively impacted, if Citi’s risk management processes, including its ability
to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or
models are deficient or ineffective. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could
also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.
Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, including its
credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to
ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements,
modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models.
Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well
as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking agencies
regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, have resulted
in, and could continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-weighted
assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s capital ratios and its ability
to achieve its regulatory capital requirements as it projects or as required.

54

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings,
Investigations and Inquiries That Could Result in Significant
Penalties and Other Negative Impacts on Citi, Its Businesses
and Results of Operations.
At any given time, Citi is defending a significant number of legal and
regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and
regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries. The global
judicial, regulatory and political environment has generally been
unfavorable for large financial institutions. The complexity of the federal
and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the
global scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event or issue may
give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory
proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by
multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions,
as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions.
Moreover, U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused
on “conduct risk,” a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior
by employees and agents, including third-party vendors utilized by Citi, that
could harm clients, customers, investors or the markets, such as improperly
creating, selling, marketing or managing products and services or improper
incentive compensation programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard
a party’s personal information, or failures to identify and manage conflicts
of interest. In addition to increasing Citi’s compliance and reputational
risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other
enforcement proceedings and civil litigation, including for practices, which
historically were acceptable but now receive greater scrutiny. Further, while
Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and
agents that could potentially harm clients, customers, investors or the
markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. Banking
regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms,
including Citi. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes
that could result from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, such focus
could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.
In addition, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory
proceedings to which Citi is subject has remained elevated. U.S. and certain
international governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal
actions against, or have sought criminal convictions from, financial
institutions, and criminal prosecutors in the U.S. have increasingly sought
and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements
against corporate entities and other criminal sanctions from those
institutions. These types of actions by U.S. and international governmental
entities may, in the future, have significant collateral consequences for
a financial institution, including loss of customers and business, and
the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate certain
businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of

criminal remedies, consent orders, sanctions, substantial fines and penalties,
remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future,
including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which
could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, business practices,
financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s
operations or cause Citi reputational harm.
Further, many large claims—both private civil and regulatory—asserted
against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel
or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to
predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes
accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting
requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these accruals involve
significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, and
the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may
be substantially higher than the amounts accrued. In addition, certain
settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved.
For additional information relating to Citi’s legal and regulatory
proceedings and matters, including Citi’s policies on establishing legal
accruals, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK
Overview

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows:

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall
operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management process has been designed to
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting
its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s mission and value
proposition, the key principles that guide it, and Citi’s risk appetite.
Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical culture. Under
Citi’s mission and value proposition, which was developed by Citi’s senior
leadership and distributed throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its
clients as a trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that
enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the
public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. As such,
Citi asks all employees to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are
in our clients’ interests, create economic value and are always systemically
responsible. Additionally, Citi evaluates employees’ performance against
behavioral expectations set out in Citi’s leadership standards, which were
designed in part to effectuate Citi’s mission and value proposition. Other
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics and leadership,
escalation and treating customers fairly help Citi to execute its mission and
value proposition.
Citi’s Company-wide risk governance framework consists of the policies,
standards, procedures and processes through which Citi identifies, assesses,
measures, manages, monitors, reports and controls risks across the Company.
It also emphasizes Citi’s risk culture and lays out standards, procedures and
programs that are designed and undertaken to enhance the Company’s
risk culture, embed this culture deeply within the organization, and give
employees tools to make sound and ethical risk decisions and to escalate
issues appropriately. The risk governance framework has been developed
in alignment with the expectations of the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC) Heightened Standards. It is also aligned with the relevant
components of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s corporate
governance principles for banks and relevant components of the Federal
Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and
Foreign Banking Organizations.
Four key principles—common purpose, responsible finance, ingenuity
and leadership—guide Citi as it performs its mission. Citi’s risk appetite,
which is approved by the Citigroup Board of Directors, specifies the aggregate
levels and types of risk the Board and management are willing to assume
to achieve Citi’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with
applicable capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
Citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying business strategy,
while striving to ensure it operates within its mission and value proposition
and risk appetite.

(or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or
issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet
efficiently both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow
and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or
financial conditions of the Company. The risk may be exacerbated by the
inability of the Company to access funding sources or monetize assets and
the composition of liability funding and liquid assets.
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of Citi’s
assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables, such as
interest rates, exchange rates or credit spreads. Losses can be exacerbated
by the presence of basis or correlation risks.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, systems or human factors, or from external
events. It includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and
regulations, but excludes strategic risk (see below). It also includes
the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or
market conduct in which Citi is involved, as well as compliance, conduct
and legal risks. Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business
activities, as well as related support, and can result in losses arising from
events related to fraud, theft and unauthorized activity; employment
practices and workplace environment; clients, products and business
practices; physical assets and infrastructure, and execution, delivery and
process management.
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition
and resilience arising from violations of laws or regulations, or from
nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and
procedures, or ethical standards. This risk exposes a bank to fines, civil
money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts.
Compliance risk is not limited to risk from failure to comply with
consumer protection laws; it encompasses the risk of noncompliance
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical standards and
contractual obligations. It also includes the exposure to litigation (known
as legal risk) from all aspects of banking, traditional and nontraditional.
Compliance risk spans across all risk types outlined in the risk
governance framework.
Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital,
or franchise or enterprise value and resilience arising from negative
public opinion.
Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or
franchise or enterprise value arising from poor, but authorized business
decisions (in compliance with regulations, policies and procedures),
an inability to adapt to changes in the operating environment or other
external factors that may impair the ability to carry out a business
strategy. Strategic risk also includes:

Officer. The Business CROs are the focal point for most day-to-day risk
decisions, such as setting risk limits and approving transactions within
the businesses. In addition there are Regional and Legal Entity Chief Risk
Officers. There are independent Chief Risk Officers for Asia, EMEA and
Latin America, including Mexico (Regional CROs). Each of these Regional
CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. The Regional CROs are
accountable for overseeing the management of all risks in their geographic
areas and across businesses, and are the primary risk contacts for the
Regional Chief Executive Officers and local regulators. Legal Entity Chief
Risk Officers are responsible for identifying and managing risks in Citibank
as well as other specific legal entities.
The Citi Chief Risk Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and the Risk
Management Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. The Chief
Risk Officer has regular and unrestricted access to the Risk Management
Committee of the Board and also to the Citigroup Board of Directors to
address risks and issues identified through Risk’s activities.

• Country risk, which is the risk that an event in a country (precipitated

by developments within or external to a country) will impair the
value of Citi’s franchise or will adversely affect the ability of obligors
within that country to honor their obligations. Country risk events may
include sovereign defaults, banking crises, currency crises, currency
convertibility and/or transferability restrictions or political events.

Citi manages its risks through each of its three lines of defense: (i) business
management, (ii) independent control functions and (iii) internal audit. The
three lines of defense collaborate with each other in structured forums and
processes to bring various perspectives together and to lead the organization
toward outcomes that are in clients’ interests, create economic value and are
systemically responsible.
First Line of Defense: Business Management

Each of Citi’s businesses owns its risks and is responsible for identifying,
assessing and managing its risks. Each business is also responsible for
establishing and operating controls to mitigate key risks, assessing internal
controls and promoting a culture of compliance and control. In doing so,
a business is required to maintain appropriate staffing and implement
appropriate procedures to fulfill its risk governance responsibilities.
The CEOs of each region and business report to the Citigroup CEO. The
Head of Enterprise Infrastructure, Operations and Technology (EIO&T), who
is considered part of the first line of defense, also reports to the Citigroup CEO.
Businesses at Citi organize and chair committees and councils that cover
risk considerations with participation from independent control functions,
including committees or councils that are designed to consider matters
related to capital, assets and liabilities, business practices, business risks and
controls, mergers and acquisitions, the Community Reinvestment Act and fair
lending and incentives.

Independent Compliance Risk Management
The Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) organization is
designed to protect Citi by overseeing senior management, the businesses and
other control functions in managing compliance risk, as well as promoting
business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s mission and value
proposition. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk
management framework and culture that identifies, measures, monitors,
mitigates and controls compliance risk across the three lines of defense. For
further information on Citi’s compliance risk framework, see “Compliance
Risk” below.
The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and
has regular and unrestricted access to the committees of the Citigroup
Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee and the Ethics and
Culture Committee.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Control Functions

Citi’s independent control functions, including Risk, Independent
Compliance Risk Management, Human Resources, Legal and Finance,
set standards by which Citi and its businesses manage and oversee risks,
including compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements,
policies and other relevant standards of conduct. Additionally, among
other responsibilities, the independent control functions provide advice and
training to Citi’s businesses and establish tools, methodologies, processes and
oversight for controls used by the businesses to foster a culture of compliance
and control.

Human Resources
The Human Resources (HR) organization provides personnel support and
governance in connection with, among other things: recognizing and
rewarding employees who demonstrate Citi’s values and excel in their roles
and responsibilities; setting ethical and performance-related expectations
and developing and promoting employees who meet those expectations,
and searching for, assessing and hiring staff who exemplify Citi’s leadership
standards, which outline Citi’s expectations of its employees’ behavior.
Through these activities, HR serves primarily as an independent control
function advising business management, escalating identified risks and
establishing policies or processes to manage risk. For select activities HR also
acts in a first line capacity and is subject to appropriate review and challenge
by second line functions.
The Head of Human Resources reports to the Citigroup CEO and interacts
regularly with the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup
Board of Directors.

Risk
The Risk organization is designed to act as an independent partner of
the business to manage market, credit and operational risk in a manner
consistent with Citi’s risk appetite. Risk establishes policies and guidelines for
risk assessments and risk management and contributes to controls and tools
to manage, measure and mitigate risks taken by the Company.
There is an independent Chief Risk Officer for each of Citi’s consumer,
commercial and corporate lending businesses within ICG and GCB (Business
CROs). Each of these Business CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk

59

Legal
The Legal organization is involved in a number of activities designed to
promote the appropriate management of Citi’s exposure to legal risk, which
includes the risk of loss, whether financial or reputational, due to legal
or regulatory actions, proceedings or investigations, or uncertainty in the
applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations. Activities
designed to promote appropriate management of legal risk include, among
others: promoting and supporting Citigroup’s governance processes; advising
business management, other independent control functions, the Citigroup
Board of Directors and committees of the Board regarding analysis of laws
and regulations, regulatory matters, disclosure matters, and potential risks
and exposures on key litigation and transactional matters, among other
things; advising other independent control functions in their efforts to
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal
standards of conduct; serving on key management committees; reporting
and escalating key legal issues to senior management or other independent
control functions; participating in internal investigations and overseeing
regulatory investigations, and advising businesses on a day-to-day basis on
legal, regulatory and contractual matters.
The General Counsel reports to the Citigroup CEO and is responsible
to the full Citigroup Board. In addition to having regular and unrestricted
access to the full Citigroup Board of Directors, the General Counsel or
his/her delegates regularly attend meetings of the Risk Management
Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee,
Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, as well as other ad
hoc committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Through the treasury discipline, Finance has overall responsibility for
managing Citi’s balance sheet and accordingly partners with the businesses
to manage Citi’s liquidity and interest rate risk (price risk for non-trading
portfolios). Treasury works with the businesses to establish balance sheet
targets and limits, as well as sets policies on funding costs charged for
business assets based on their liquidity and duration.
Principally through the controllers discipline, Finance is responsible for
establishing a strong control environment over Citi’s financial reporting
processes consistent with the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission, or COSO, Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Finance is led by Citi’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who reports directly
to the Citigroup CEO. The CFO chairs or co-chairs several management
committees that serve as key governance and oversight forums for business
activities. In addition, the CFO has regular and unrestricted access to the full
Citigroup Board of Directors as well as to the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors.
Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit

Citi’s Internal Audit function independently reviews activities of the first two
lines of defense based on a risk-based audit plan and methodology approved
by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Internal Audit
also provides independent assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, the
Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators regarding
the effectiveness of Citi’s governance and controls designed to mitigate Citi’s
exposure to risks and to enhance Citi’s culture of compliance and control.
The Chief Auditor reports functionally to the Chairman of the Citigroup
Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO of Citigroup. Internal
Audit’s responsibilities are carried out independently under the oversight of
the Audit Committee. Internal Audit’s employees accordingly report to the
Chief Auditor and do not have reporting lines to front-line units or senior
management. Internal Audit’s staff members are not permitted to provide
internal-audit services for a business line or function in which they had
business line or function responsibilities within the previous 12 months.

Finance
The Finance organization is primarily composed of the following disciplines:
treasury, controllers, tax and financial planning and analysis, capital
planning/recovery and resolution planning, corporate M&A and investor
relations. These disciplines partner with the businesses, providing key data
and consultation to facilitate sound decisions in support of the businesses’
objectives. Through these activities, Finance serves primarily as an
independent control function advising business management, escalating
identified risks and establishing policies or processes to manage risk. For
select activities Finance also acts in a first line capacity and is subject to
appropriate review and challenge by second line functions.

Citigroup Board of Directors and Committees
of the Board

The standing committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors are the
Executive Committee, Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee,
Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee,
Operations and Technology Committee and Nomination, Governance and
Public Affairs Committee. In addition to the standing committees, the Board
creates ad hoc committees from time to time in response to regulatory, legal
or other requirements.

Citigroup’s Board of Directors oversees Citi’s risk-taking activities and holds
management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. To
do so, directors review reports prepared by the businesses, Risk, Independent
Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and others, and exercise sound
independent judgment to question, probe and challenge recommendations
and decisions made by management.

61

CREDIT RISK
To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi has in place
a correlation framework consisting of industry limits, an idiosyncratic
framework consisting of single name concentrations for each business and
across Citigroup and a specialized framework consisting of product limits.
Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual
loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other offbalance sheet commitments are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed
as the current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed
to Citi by a given counterparty.
The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of
the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as well as the terms and
conditions of the specific obligation. Citi assesses the credit risk associated
with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve
process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements), as well as through regular stress testing at the
company, business, geography and product levels. These stress-testing
processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would
occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the
obligors or counterparties.
For additional information on Citi’s credit risk management, see Note 14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overview

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality or the
failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial
or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business
activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending;
capital markets derivative transactions;
structured finance; and
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements, securities loaned and borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities, when Citi
transfers an asset in advance of receiving its counter-value or advances funds
to settle a transaction on behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit
risk, is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a
specific client, industry, region or other category.
Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as an institution.
For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Credit Risk” above. As a
result, Citi has a well-established framework in place for managing credit
risk across all businesses. This includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits
and credit policies, both at the business level as well as at the Company-wide
level. Citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with
respect to problem recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews,
stress tests, updated risk ratings and classification triggers.
With respect to Citi’s settlement and clearing activities, intraday client
usage of lines is monitored against limits, as well as against usage patterns.
To the extent a problem develops, Citi typically moves the client to a secured
(collateralized) operating model. Generally, Citi’s intraday settlement and
clearing lines are uncommitted and cancelable at any time.

62

As stated in “Global Consumer Banking” above, GCB’s overall strategy
is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the
affluent and emerging affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit
cards and in certain retail markets (including commercial banking), Citi
serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.
GCB’s commercial banking business primarily focuses on small to
mid-size businesses and also serves larger middle market companies in
certain regions.

Consumer Credit

Citi provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and
credit card products in 19 countries and jurisdictions through North America
GCB, Latin America GCB and Asia GCB. The retail banking products
include consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and commercial loans
and lines of credit and similar related products with a focus on lending to
prime customers. Citi uses its risk appetite framework to define its lending
parameters. In addition, Citi uses proprietary scoring models for new
customer approvals.

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through Citibanamex, one of
Mexico’s largest banks, and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages,
personal loans and commercial banking products. Latin America GCB
serves a more mass market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing
multi-product relationships with customers.
As shown in the chart above, the quarter-over-quarter 90+ days past
due delinquency rate increased in Latin America GCB, mostly driven by
seasonality in the cards portfolio. The quarter-over-quarter net credit loss rate
decreased, primarily reflecting the absence of an episodic charge-off in the
commercial portfolio in the prior quarter. The year-over-year delinquency
and net credit loss rates increased, driven primarily by seasoning of the
cards portfolio.

North America GCB provides mortgages, home equity loans, personal
loans and commercial banking products through Citi’s retail banking
network and card products through Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services
businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in six major metropolitan cities
in the United States (for additional information on the U.S. retail bank, see
“North America GCB” above).
As of December 31, 2018, 72% of North America GCB consumer loans
consisted of Citi-branded and Citi retail services cards, which generally
drives the overall credit performance of North America GCB (for additional
information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, including
delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit Card Trends” below).
As shown in the chart above, the 90+ days past due delinquency rate
increased quarter-over-quarter in North America GCB, primarily due to
seasonality in both cards portfolios, while the quarter-over-quarter increase
in the net credit loss rate was primarily driven by seasonality in Citi retail
services. The year-over-year delinquency and net credit loss rates increased,
driven by seasoning in both cards portfolios as well as an increase in net flow
rates in later delinquency buckets in Citi retail services.

(1) Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries in Asia and EMEA and provides credit
cards, consumer mortgages, personal loans and commercial banking products.
As shown in the chart above, the 90+ days past due delinquency rate was
largely stable in Asia GCB quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The net
credit loss rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily
driven by an episodic charge-off in the commercial portfolio in the fourth
quarter of 2018. Overall, the strong credit profiles in Asia GCB’s target
customer segments have resulted in stable portfolio credit quality.
For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other
information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business’s

Citi retail services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and
dealers to offer private label and co-branded consumer and commercial
cards. Citi retail services’ target market is focused on select industry segments
such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel.
Citi retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and
growth potential.
As shown in the chart above, Citi retail services’ 90+ days past due
delinquency and net credit loss rates increased quarter-over-quarter,
driven by seasonality as well as the business beginning to incur losses in a
recently acquired portfolio. The year-over-year increase in the delinquency
rate was primarily driven by seasoning and an increase in net flow
rates in later delinquency buckets. On this basis, the net credit loss rate
modestly decreased, as the impact of the recently acquired portfolios was
partially offset by seasoning as well as an increase in net flow rates in later
delinquency buckets.

and co-branded cards. As shown in the chart above, the 90+ days past due
delinquency rate in Citi-branded cards increased quarter-over-quarter due
to seasonality, and was relatively stable year-over-year. The net credit loss
rate was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, while the net credit loss rate
increased year-over-year due to seasoning of the portfolio as well as the
impact of higher asset sales in the prior year.

Asia GCB issues proprietary and co-branded cards. As shown in the
chart above, the 90+ days past due delinquency rate remained broadly
stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the mature
and well-diversified cards portfolios. The net credit loss rate decreased
quarter-over-quarter, as the prior quarter reflected a higher rate due to the
conversion of an acquired portfolio in Australia, while the net credit loss rate
was broadly stable year-over-year.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.

(3) The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until
180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.
(4) The loans 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America GCB exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential
loss predominantly resides within the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $201 million ($0.6 billion), $298 million ($0.7 billion) and $327 million ($0.7 billion)
at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (EOP loans have the same adjustment as above) were $78 million, $88 million and $70 million at

obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered
investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.
Citigroup has also incorporated environmental factors such as climate
risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors, as necessary.
Factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an obligor’s
business and physical assets and, when relevant, consideration of costeffective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk
rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the
corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across
all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk
ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are
derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models, scorecard
models and external agency ratings (under defined circumstances),
in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or
market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that
reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the
loss-given-default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal

Industry of Hedged Exposure
December 31,

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit
derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in
its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The results
of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives
are reflected primarily in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement
of Income.
At December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017,
$30.8 billion, $26.9 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, of the corporate
credit portfolio was economically hedged. Citigroup’s expected loss model
used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable
impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market.
In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded
lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these
hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging
underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk
rating distribution:

Technology, media and telecom

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans

There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans and
assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary provides a general
description of each category.
Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

• Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) non-accrual
•

•
•

•

status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal
is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still be performing
under the terms of the loan structure. Non-accrual loans may still be
current on interest payments. Approximately 55%, 57% and 74% of Citi’s
corporate non-accrual loans were performing at December 31, 2018,
September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, i.e., the
borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration
(FHA) insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of
notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first
mortgage loan is 90 days or more past due.
North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services are not included
because, under industry standards, credit card loans accrue interest
until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days of
contractual delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

• Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms have been
•

modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as of the periods
indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In
situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal

owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a
reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual
loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

LIQUIDITY RISK
and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets.
This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before asset maturities
or monetizations through sale. This excess liquidity is held primarily in the
form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table below.
Citi’s Treasurer has overall responsibility for management of Citi’s HQLA.
Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by Corporate
Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-country treasurers. Pursuant
to this approach, Citi’s HQLA are managed with emphasis on asset-liability
management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.
Citi’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall liquidity risk profile
of Citi. The Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s CFO co-chair Citi’s Asset Liability
Management Committee (ALCO), which includes Citi’s Treasurer and
other senior executives. ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and
monitors its performance. Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations
need to be approved by ALCO.

Overview

Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s
businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of
which are mostly or entirely outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the
financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes
in Citi’s credit ratings and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. For
additional information, see “Risk Factors” above.
Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing
asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient
liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety
of adverse circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or
market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying
regulatory requirements, including, among other things, those related to
resolution planning (for additional information, see “Resolution Plan”
and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary
liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two
major categories:

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating
subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are
intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on
the balance sheet and liquidity position, and to identify viable funding
alternatives that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions about
significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit
ratings), potential uses of funding and geopolitical and macroeconomic
conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed market conditions
as well as Company-specific events.
Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches
between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over
different stressed conditions. Liquidity limits are set accordingly. To monitor
the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are
calculated with varying frequencies, with several tests performed daily.
Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains contingency funding
plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify
a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market
conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.

• Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Ltd. and
Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and

• the non-bank and other, which includes the parent holding company

(Citigroup), Citi’s primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC),
Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.)
and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into
Citigroup (including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate level, Citigroup’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding
in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an
appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed
below), even in times of stress. The liquidity risk management framework
provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established
under their designated stress tests.
Citi’s primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via Citi’s bank
subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding, (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated
debt) primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries, and
(iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term
borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.
As referenced above, Citi works to ensure that the tenor of these funding
sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The goal
of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there is excess liquidity

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are
encumbered and incorporate any haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions.
(1) Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity
requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, India, Mexico and Brazil.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that Citi has developed for a
30-day stress scenario, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR,
as calculated pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules.
Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate
level of HQLA to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario.
The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows over
a stressed 30-day period, with the net outflows determined by applying
prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities, such as deposits,
unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings, unused lending commitments
and derivatives-related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets
maturing within 30 days. Banks are required to calculate an add-on to
address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows
and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net
outflows. The minimum LCR requirement is 100%.
The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation and
HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup’s
operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of
Citigroup’s consolidated LCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these
entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums that are assumed to
be transferable to Citigroup. While available liquidity resources at operating
entities remained largely unchanged, the amount of HQLA included in the
table above declined both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as less
HQLA in the operating entities was eligible for inclusion in the consolidated
metric. Quarter-over-quarter, the decline in HQLA was also driven by balance
sheet optimization as Citi deployed cash to fund loan growth and reduce
debt levels.
Citi’s HQLA does not include Citi’s available borrowing capacity from
the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) of which Citi is a member, which
was approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2018 (unchanged from
September 30, 2018 and compared to $10 billion as of December 31, 2017)
and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks. The HQLA also
does not include Citi’s borrowing capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
discount window or other central banks, which would be in addition to the
resources noted above.
In general, Citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities within its bank
group. Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, can lend to the Citi parent
and broker-dealer entities in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal
Reserve Act. As of December 31, 2018, the capacity available for lending to
these entities under Section 23A was approximately $15 billion, unchanged
from both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, subject to certain
eligible non-cash collateral requirements.

Citi’s LCR decreased year-over-year, driven by a decline in average HQLA,
partially offset by a decline in modeled net outflows. Quarter-over-quarter,
Citi’s LCR increased slightly, as a decline in modeled net outflows more than
offset the decline in average HQLA (see “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above).

Loans

As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to fund its existing
asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow
its GCB and ICG businesses, including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a
diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The
table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the
total end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC issued a proposed
rule to implement the Basel III NSFR requirement.
The U.S.-proposed NSFR is largely consistent with the Basel Committee’s
final NSFR rules. In general, the NSFR assesses the availability of a bank’s
stable funding against a required level. A bank’s available stable funding
would include portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its
required stable funding would be based on the liquidity characteristics and
encumbrance period of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Prescribed
factors would be required to be applied to the various categories of asset and
liabilities classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable
funding would be required to be greater than 100%. While Citi believes that
it is compliant with the proposed U.S. NSFR rules as of December 31, 2018,
it will need to evaluate a final version of the rules, which are expected to
be released in 2019. Citi expects that the NSFR final rules implementation
period will be communicated along with the final version of the rules.

Loans increased 3% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter in the
fourth quarter, on both an end-of-period as well as on an average basis.
Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans increased 4% yearover-year, driven by 6% aggregate across GCB and ICG. Within GCB, average
loans grew 3%, with growth across all regions and businesses, with particular
strength in North America GCB driven by Citi-branded cards and Citi retail
services, including the impact of the L.L.Bean card portfolio acquisition.
Average ICG loans increased 8% year-over-year, with continued growth
across businesses. Corporate lending and private bank loan growth remained
strong on a year-over-year basis, with corporate lending unchanged quarterover-quarter due to the episodic nature of repayments relative to originations.
TTS loans grew year-over-year, however growth moderated to 2%, despite
continued strong origination volumes, as Citi utilized its distribution
capabilities to optimize the balance sheet and drive returns. Finally, strong
year-over-year Markets and securities services loan growth was driven
by Community Reinvestment Act lending activities as well as residential
warehouse lending.
Average Corporate/Other loans continued to decline (down 32%), driven
by the wind-down of legacy assets.

(1) Includes deposits in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

End-of-period deposits increased 6% year-over-year and 1% quarter-overquarter. On an average basis, deposits increased 3% year-over-year and 2%
quarter-over-quarter.
Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits increased 5%
year-over-year. In GCB, deposits increased 1%, as strong growth in Asia GCB
and Latin America GCB more than offset a 1% decline in North America
GCB, as clients transferred cash into investment accounts.
In ICG, deposits increased 6%, primarily driven by continued high-quality
deposit growth in TTS.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet which,
for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized
discounts and premiums.
(1) “Parent and other” includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company
(Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated
into Citigroup. As of December 31, 2018, “parent and other” included $27.0 billion of long-term debt
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries.
(2) Local country debt includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations.
(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding decreased both year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by a
decline in long-term debt at the bank, as declines in FHLB advances more
than offset an increase in unsecured senior benchmark debt. At the parent,
long-term debt remained largely unchanged year-over-year, as declines in
unsecured benchmark debt were largely offset by increases in customerrelated debt. Quarter-over-quarter, the decrease was driven primarily by
declines in unsecured senior debt at the parent and the bank.
As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue
to consider, opportunities to repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to
open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such repurchases
help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 2018, Citi repurchased an
aggregate of approximately $5.4 billion of its outstanding long-term debt,
including early redemptions of FHLB advances.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original maturities of one
year or more) represents the most significant component of Citi’s funding
for the parent entities and is a supplementary source of funding for the
bank entities.
Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part to its
multi-year contractual maturity structure. The weighted-average maturity
of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including
Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately
6.8 years as of December 31, 2018, a slight decline from 6.9 years as of
September 30, 2018 and unchanged from the prior year.
Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the parent company includes senior
and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt,
consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-related debt is
generally driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt

Resolution Plan
Citi is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and the rules
promulgated by the FDIC and FRB to periodically submit a plan for Citi’s
rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of
material financial distress or failure. For additional information on Citi’s
resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.
Citigroup’s preferred resolution strategy is “single point of entry” under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Under Citi’s resolution plan, only Citigroup, the parent holding company,
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal entities (as
defined in the public section of its 2017 resolution plan, which can be found
on the FRB’s and FDIC’s websites) would remain operational and outside of
any resolution or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup believes its resolution
plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S.
and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy
estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, including its unsecured
long-term debt holders. In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve’s
final total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has
developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured
creditors—including its unsecured long-term debt holders—bear any losses
resulting from Citigroup’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by
holders of its unsecured long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the
amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other
resolution proceeding of Citigroup.
The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a single point of
entry strategy to implement its resolution authority under Title II of the
Dodd-Frank Act.
In response to feedback received from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on
Citigroup’s 2015 resolution plan, Citigroup took the following actions in
connection with its 2017 resolution plan submission:

(iv) the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the Citi Support
Agreement, as well as the Contributable Assets, are secured pursuant to a
security agreement.
The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, besides Citicorp’s
issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant to which Citicorp will be required
to transfer cash to Citigroup during business as usual so that Citigroup can
fund its debt service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more funding
notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a committed line of credit under
which Citicorp may make loans to Citigroup.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board imposed minimum external TLAC
and long-term debt (LTD) requirements on U.S. global systemically
important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi, effective as
of January 1, 2019. As a result, U.S. GSIBs will be required to maintain
minimum levels of TLAC and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the
GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure,
as described further below. The intended purpose of the requirements is to
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Citi believes it exceeded the
minimum TLAC and LTD requirements as of December, 31, 2018. For
additional information, see “Risk Factors—Compliance, Conduct and Legal
Risks” above.
Minimum TLAC Requirements
The minimum TLAC requirement is the greater of (i) 18% of the GSIB’s RWA
plus the then-applicable RWA-based TLAC buffer (see below) and (ii) 7.5% of
the GSIB’s total leverage exposure plus a leveraged-based TLAC buffer of 2%
(i.e., 9.5%).
The RWA-based TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital conservation buffer,
plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer (currently 0%), plus
the GSIB’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB
surcharge rule (2.0% for Citi for 2019). Accordingly, Citi estimates its total
current minimum TLAC requirement is 22.5% of RWA for 2019.

(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned subsidiary of
Citigroup, was established as an intermediate holding company (an
IHC) for certain of Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;
(ii) Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with Citicorp,
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities and certain other affiliated
entities pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide liquidity
and capital support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings (Citi
Support Agreement);
(iii) pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

Minimum Eligible LTD Requirements
The minimum LTD requirement is the greater of (i) 6% of the GSIB’s
RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the GSIB
surcharge rule (3.0% for Citi for 2019), for a total current requirement of 9%
of RWA for Citi, and (ii) 4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure.
For additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 GSIB capital
surcharge methodologies, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory
Capital Standards” above.

• Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, including certain
high-quality liquid assets and inter-affiliate loans (Contributable
Assets), to Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business as usual
funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;
• Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer Contributable Assets
to Citicorp over time, subject to certain amounts retained by Citigroup
to, among other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash needs;
• in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will be required to
contribute most of its remaining assets to Citicorp; and

86

2% from the prior quarter, both driven by normal business activity. Average
balances for secured funding were $177 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2018.
The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that
funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity.
The majority of this activity is secured by high-quality liquid securities such
as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government
debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less-liquid securities,
including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. The
tenor of Citi’s matched book liabilities is generally equal to or longer than
the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets.
The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer
subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market
making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide
range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying
collateral and stipulating financing tenor. The weighted average maturity
of Citi’s secured funding of less-liquid securities inventory was greater than
110 days as of December 31, 2018.
Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress
tests to account for changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and
client actions. Additionally, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and
stability under stress. Citi generally sources secured funding from more than
150 counterparties.

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term
Borrowings

Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term borrowings.
Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured funding transactions
(securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos) and
(ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper
and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants (see Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup’s
and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings).
Outside of secured funding transactions, Citi’s short-term borrowings
decreased both year-over-year (27% decrease) and quarter-over-quarter
(4% decrease), driven primarily by Citi’s continued efforts to optimize its
funding profile.
Secured Funding
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer
subsidiaries to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a
portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and
customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding
transactions through its bank entities, which is typically collateralized by
foreign government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the level of
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending
activity in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory.
Secured funding of $178 billion as of December 31, 2018 increased 14%
from the prior year and 1% from the prior quarter. Excluding the impact
of FX translation, secured funding increased 17% from the prior year and

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to access capital
markets and other sources of funds, the cost of these funds and its ability to
maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings.
The table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of
December 31, 2018. While not included in the table below, the long- and
short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were

Recent Credit Ratings Developments
On November 29, 2018, Moody’s placed the long-term ratings of Citigroup
and Citibank, N.A. on “Review for Possible Upgrade.” Over the course of
the review period, Moody’s will assess, among other things, Citi’s ability
to achieve its medium-term efficiency and profitability targets while
maintaining strong governance and risk controls.
On February 21, 2019, Moody’s upgraded the ratings for long-term debt,
deposits and counterparty risk of Citigroup and certain of its subsidiaries, as
well as the baseline credit assessment (BCA) of Citibank, N.A. In addition,
Moody’s affirmed all short-term ratings and assessments of Citigroup and
those subsidiaries. The ratings outlook was changed to “Stable” from
“Review for Possible Upgrade.”

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2018, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch
downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all
three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity
due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.2 billion, compared to
$0.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. Other funding sources, such as secured
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are
no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
As of December 31, 2018, Citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across
all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank’s funding and
liquidity by approximately $0.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion as of
September 30, 2018.
In total, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and
Citibank, across all three major rating agencies, could result in increased
aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately
$0.7 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 (see also
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As detailed under “HighQuality Liquid Assets” above, the liquidity resources that are eligible for
inclusion in the calculation of Citi’s consolidated HQLA were approximately
$339 billion for Citibank and $65 billion for Citi’s non-bank and other
entities, for a total of approximately $404 billion as of December 31, 2018.
These liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the
potential events described above.
In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included
in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup,
these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus
funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending
and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings
from certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank
include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government
securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select
trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these
mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk,
if any, of the potential downgrades described above.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could negatively impact
Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding
capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash
obligations and collateral requirements.
The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing
the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of
a hypothetical, simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major
rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential
ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible
counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For
example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could
re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in
certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty
behavior could impact Citi’s funding and liquidity, as well as the results
of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup
or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential
funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on
the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see
“Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

88

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential
downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three
major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial
paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of December 31, 2018, Citibank
had liquidity commitments of approximately $13.2 billion to consolidated
asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $12.1 billion
as of September 30, 2018 (as referenced in Note 21 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank
entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the
potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits.
In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that
certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships
with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which
could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could
choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the
mitigating actions referenced above.

89

MARKET RISK
Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated Company-wide position.
Citi’s client-facing businesses create interest rate sensitive positions,
including loans and deposits, as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury
aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating
within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning decisions and uses
tools, such as Citi’s investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and
interest rate derivatives, to target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s
interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading
assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting impacts, as well as
in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.
Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the
impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance
sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they
relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, and the potential
impact of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Overview

Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of
Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such
as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and
credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities. Market risk emanates from
both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on
market risk, see “Risk Factors” above.
Each business is required to establish, with approval from Citi’s market
risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors
that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters
of Citi’s overall risk appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk
organization, Citi’s country and business Asset and Liability Committees and
the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee. In all cases, the businesses are
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within
their defined limits.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact
on AOCI

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios

Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the potential impact of
changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest
revenues, the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) (AOCI) from its debt securities portfolios and capital invested in
foreign currencies.

Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on
the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s common equity and
tangible common equity. This will impact Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and
other regulatory capital ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the
market level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI
on its regulatory capital position.
AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate
risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential changes in AOCI (and the
corresponding impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to
Citi’s capital generation capacity.

Net Interest Revenue at Risk

Net interest revenue, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the difference
between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including
customer loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer
deposits or company borrowings). Net interest revenue is affected by changes
in the level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets and
liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and
liabilities to reflect market rates.
Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate
exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected net interest revenue
in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward
interest rates.
Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions including
prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and the impact of pricing
decisions. For example, in rising interest rate scenarios, portions of the
deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less
than the change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate scenarios,
it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates.
IRE assumes that businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional
changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated
rate changes.
In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, Citi may modify
pricing on new customer loans and deposits, purchase fixed-rate securities,
issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions
that have the opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of
these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements
such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent.

(1) Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table, since these exposures are managed economically in
combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(242) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018.
(2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.
(3) Results as of December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position.

The 2018 decrease in the estimated impact to net interest revenue
primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance sheet composition, including
increased sensitivity in deposits combined with loan growth, and Citi
Treasury positioning. The 2018 changes in the estimated impact to AOCI and
the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of the
composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and derivatives portfolio.
In the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase
in interest rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI would be offset
in shareholders’ equity through the combination of expected incremental

net interest revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI
through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time. As of
December 31, 2018, Citi expects that the negative $3.9 billion impact to AOCI
in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 18 months.
The following table shows the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest
revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under four
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and Citi’s
other currencies.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated.
(1) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi’s net
interest revenue and AOCI is greater under scenario 2 as compared to
scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi’s investment
portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities,
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and
intermediate-term maturities.

also change the value of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those
currencies. This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, such
as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency
hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements
on Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further
affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital
as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.
The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to
changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on
Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio are shown in the table
below. For additional information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI
and Capital

As of December 31, 2018, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel
instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other
currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible
common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.4 billion, or 1.0%, as a result
of changes to Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the
Mexican peso, the Euro and the Australian dollar.
This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take,
including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation
exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi’s
net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements

Note: All interest expense amounts include FDIC insurance assessments, as well as similar deposit insurance assessments outside of the U.S. As of the fourth quarter of 2018, Citi’s FDIC surcharge was eliminated
(approximately $130 million per quarter).
(1) Net interest revenue includes the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rates of 21% in 2018 and 35% in 2017 and 2016) of $254 million,
$496 million and $462 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(2) Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above.
(3) Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets.

Citi’s net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 5% to
$11.9 billion ($12.0 billion on a taxable equivalent basis) versus the prioryear period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, net interest revenue
increased 8%, or approximately $0.9 billion. This increase was primarily
due to higher net interest revenue ($11.7 billion, up approximately 14% or
$1.4 billion) from Citi’s core accrual activities, which is mainly generated by
its deposit and lending businesses. The increase in core accrual net interest
revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue
($0.1 billion, down approximately 83% or $0.4 billion), largely due to
higher wholesale funding costs, and lower net interest revenue associated

with the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other ($0.1 billion, down
approximately 45% or $0.1 billion). The increase in core accrual net interest
revenue was mainly driven by the deployment of cash into better yielding
assets, including loans, an improved loan mix and higher interest rates,
as well as the impact of elimination of the FDIC surcharge. As previously
disclosed, in 2016, the FDIC commenced imposing a surcharge on depository
institutions, including Citibank, to increase the deposit insurance fund
reserve ratio until it reached 1.35%, which occurred as of the end of the third
quarter of 2018.

93

Citi’s net interest revenue for the full year increased 3% to $46.6 billion
($46.8 billion on a taxable equivalent basis) versus the prior year. Excluding
the impact of FX translation, Citi’s net interest revenue increased by
approximately $2.0 billion, as higher core accrual net interest revenue
(approximately $44.1 billion, up 10% or $4.1 billion) was offset by lower
trading-related net interest revenue (approximately $1.0 billion, down
62% or $1.7 billion), largely driven by higher wholesale funding costs, and
lower net interest revenue associated with legacy assets in Corporate/Other
(approximately $0.8 billion, down 38% or $0.5 billion). The increase in core
accrual net interest revenue was primarily due to loan growth, an improved
loan mix, and higher interest rates.
Citi’s NIM was 2.71% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter
of 2018, an increase of 1 basis point (bp) from the third quarter of 2018,
driven primarily by the increase in core accrual net interest revenue, and
the impact of the elimination of the FDIC surcharge, partially offset by lower
trading-related NIM. Citi’s core accrual NIM was 3.72%, an increase of 12 bps
from the third quarter of 2018, primarily driven by the deployment of cash
into better yielding assets, including loans, an improved loan mix and higher
interest rates, as well as the impact of elimination of the FDIC surcharge.
On a full-year basis, Citi’s NIM was 2.69% on a taxable equivalent basis,
compared to 2.73% in 2017, a decrease of 4 bps. Citi’s full-year core accrual
NIM was 3.61%, an increase of 13 bps from the prior year, primarily driven
by loan growth, an improved loan mix and higher interest rates. (Citi’s core
accrual net interest revenue and core accrual NIM are non-GAAP financial
measures. Citi believes the presentation of its net interest revenue and NIM
on a core accrual basis provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the
underlying fundamentals of its businesses).

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue (loss) captures
trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for Citi’s
trading businesses fell within particular ranges. Trading-related revenue
includes trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s
trading businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments incurred due
to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, as well as any associated
hedges to that CVA. In addition, it excludes fees and other revenue associated
with capital markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading
inventory. As shown in the chart, positive trading-related revenue was
achieved for 98.1% of the trading days in 2018.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market making activities,
hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the CVA relating
to derivative counterparties and all associated hedges, fair value option
loans, and hedges to the loan portfolio within capital markets origination
within ICG.
The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a
combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, including, but not
limited to:

• factor sensitivities;
• value at risk (VAR); and
• stress testing.
Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own market risk
limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including
trading mandates, new product approval, permitted product lists, and pretrade approval for larger, more complex and less liquid transactions.

at fair value; it does not include investment securities classified as AFS or
HTM. For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate
fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most
recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. The Monte
Carlo simulation involves approximately 450,000 market factors, making
use of approximately 350,000 time series, with sensitivities updated daily,
volatility parameters updated intra-month and correlation parameters
updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute
an approximate 20% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets.
As shown in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR modestly decreased
in 2018 compared to the prior year, mainly due to a minor reduction in
average credit spreads, partially offset by a minor increase in interest rate
exposure within ICG. Additionally, among secondary factors with limited
contribution to Citi’s average VAR, equity risk increased mainly due to
exposure changes in the Equities business, partially offset by a modest
decrease in commodity exposures within ICG. The decrease in Citi’s average
trading and credit portfolio VAR from 2018 was in line with the decrease in
average trading VAR, as the average incremental impact of the credit portfolio
was unchanged.

Factor Sensitivities

Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for
a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a
U.S. Treasury bill for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citi’s market
risk management, within the Risk organization, works to ensure that factor
sensitivities are calculated, monitored and limited for all material risks taken
in the trading portfolios.
Value at Risk (VAR)

VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential decline in the value of
a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period. VAR statistics, which are based on historical data, can be
materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition,
differences in VAR methodologies and differences in model parameters. As a
result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators
of trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for inferring
differences in risk-taking across firms.
Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo simulation VAR
model (see “VAR Model Review and Validation” below), which has been
designed to capture material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of various asset classes/
risk types (such as interest rate, credit spread, foreign exchange, equity
and commodity risks). Citi’s VAR includes positions which are measured

Total trading and credit portfolio VAR

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each individual risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within each
and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each individual risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of
changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.
(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale
and accrual exposures are not included.
(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.
(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The
credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges within capital markets origination in ICG.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes all trading
book-covered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures.
Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet
the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as
non-trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded
as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes CVA on derivative instruments
and DVA on Citi’s own fair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded
from Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as computed

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process entails reviewing
the model framework, major assumptions and implementation of the
mathematical algorithm. In addition, as part of the model validation
process, product specific back-testing on portfolios is periodically completed
and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory
VAR back-testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold
profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios across the
organization (trading desk level, ICG business segment and Citigroup) and
the results are shared with U.S. banking regulators.
Significant VAR model and assumption changes must be independently
validated within Citi’s risk management organization. This validation
process includes a review by model validation group within Citi’s Model Risk
Management. In the event of significant model changes, parallel model runs
are undertaken prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by Citi’s
U.S. banking regulators.
Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model for both Regulatory
VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and
credit portfolios VARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process
for both purposes is as described above.
Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with Basel III, differs
from Risk Management VAR due to the fact that certain positions included
in Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk treatment in
Regulatory VAR. The composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed
under “Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to
evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR backtesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence
interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and
loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced
the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily markto-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions
from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss
excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.
Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in
any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceeded the Regulatory VAR. Given
the conservative calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities),
Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market
conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number
of back-testing exceptions.
The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit and loss
associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory
VAR during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, there was one back-testing
exception observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR for the prior 12 months, due to
market moves triggered by political events in Italy.

The difference between the 49.8% of days with buy-and-hold gains for
Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 98.1% of days with trading, net interest
and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the
histogram of daily trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other

things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is not
generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures, as
well as differences in the portfolio composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk
Management VAR.

(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business
day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the
trading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-related revenue above.

Stress Testing

The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress scenarios at
Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to
calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk. In general, changes
in market values are defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid
positions and market factors, changes in market values are defined over a
shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and market factors
whose market value changes are defined over a two-month horizon are those
that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid
during financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other positions
and market factors materially declined.

Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate
the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on individual
positions and trading portfolios, as well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple
trading portfolios. Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with
the businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios, reviews
the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and uses the information to
assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses
two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major
risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, commodity, interest rate and
credit spreads): top-down systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific
stresses. Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of
extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, and are constructed
using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse
economic scenarios. Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks
of particular portfolios and market segments, especially those risks that are
not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.

OPERATIONAL RISK
An Operational Risk Management Committee has been established to
provide oversight for operational risk across Citigroup and to provide a
forum to assess Citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken
so that Citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent
with Citi’s risk appetite. The Committee seeks to ensure that these actions
address the root causes that persistently lead to operational risk losses and
create lasting solutions to minimize these losses. Members include Citi’s
Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s Head of Operational Risk and senior members
of their organizations. These members cover multiple dimensions of risk
management and include business and regional Chief Risk Officers and
senior operational risk managers.
In addition, risk management, including Operational Risk Management,
works proactively with the businesses and other independent control
functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and
framework across Citi. Operational Risk Management engages with the
businesses to ensure effective implementation of the Operational Risk
Management framework by focusing on (i) identification, analysis and
assessment of operational risks, (ii) effective challenge of key control issues
and operational risks and (iii) anticipation and mitigation of operational
risk events.
Information about the businesses’ operational risk, historical operational
risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business
segment and functional area. The information is summarized and reported
to senior management, as well as to the Audit Committee of Citi’s Board
of Directors.
Operational risk is measured and assessed through risk capital. Projected
operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the
Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see “Risk Factors—
Operational Risk” above.

Overview

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, systems or human factors, or from external events. It
includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations, but
excludes strategic risk. Operational risk includes the reputation and franchise
risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which Citi is
involved, as well as compliance, conduct and legal risks.
Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well
as related support functions, and can result in losses arising from events
associated with the following, among others:

•
•
•
•
•

fraud, theft and unauthorized activity;
employment practices and workplace environment;
clients, products and business practices;
physical assets and infrastructure; and
execution, delivery and process management.

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework
described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. The Company’s goal
is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics
of Citi’s businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity
and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment.
To anticipate, mitigate and control operational risk, Citi has
established policies and a global framework for assessing, monitoring and
communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of
the internal control environment across Citigroup. As part of this framework,
Citi has defined its operational risk appetite and has established a manager’s
control assessment (MCA) process (a process through which managers at
Citi identify, monitor, measure, report on and manage risks and the related
controls) to help managers self-assess significant operational risks and key
controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design and/or operating
effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks.
Each major business segment must implement an operational risk
process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The process for
operational risk management includes the following steps:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Cybersecurity Risk

Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the threat posed by a
cyber attack, cyber breach or the failure to protect Citi’s most vital business
information assets or operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss
(for additional information, see the operational systems and cybersecurity
risk factors in “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). With an evolving
threat landscape, ever increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks and
use of new technologies to conduct financial transactions, Citi and its clients,
customers and third parties are and will continue to be at risk for cyber
attacks and information security incidents. Citi recognizes the significance
of these risks and, therefore, employs an intelligence-led strategy to prevent,
detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. Further, Citi actively
participates in financial industry, government, and cross-sector knowledge
sharing groups to enhance individual and collective cyber resilience.

identify and assess key operational risks;
design controls to mitigate identified risks;
establish key risk indicators;
implement a process for early problem recognition and timely escalation;
produce comprehensive operational risk reporting; and
ensure that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the
operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.

As new products and business activities are developed, processes are
designed, modified or sourced through alternative means and operational
risks are considered.

104

Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built
on three lines of defense. Citi’s first line of defense includes its Information
Protection Directorate and Global Information Security group, which
provides frontline business, operational and technical controls and
capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks, and to respond to cyber
incidents and data breaches. Citi manages these threats through state-ofthe-art Fusion Centers, which serve as central command for monitoring
and coordinating responses to cyber threats. The enterprise information
security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls,
performing vulnerability assessments and third-party information security
assessments, employee awareness and training programs, and security
incident management, in each case working in coordination with a network
of information security officers that are embedded within the businesses and
functions on a global basis.
Citi’s Operational Risk Management-Technology and Cyber (ORMT/C) and Independent Compliance Risk Management-Technology and
Information Security (ICRM-T) groups serve as the second line of defense,
and actively evaluate, anticipate and challenge Citi’s risk mitigation practices
and capabilities. Internal audit serves as the third line of defense and
independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a
whole manages cybersecurity risk. Citi’s Information Security Risk Operating
Committee (ISROC) has overall responsibility for information security across
Citi, and facilitates communication, discussion, escalation and management
of cyber risks across these functions.
Citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and
cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively
affect business operations. Accordingly, the ORM-T/C team independently
challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with Citi’s defined
Technology and Cyber Risk Appetite statements. To address evolving
cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations, ORM-T/C also monitors
cyber legal and regulatory requirements, defines and identifies emerging
risks, executes strategic cyber threat assessments, performs new products and
initiative reviews, performs data management risk oversight, and conducts
cyber risk assurance reviews (inclusive of third-party assessments). In
addition, ORM-T/C employs and develops tools and metrics that are both
tailored to cybersecurity and technology, and aligned with Citi’s overall
operational risk management framework to effectively track, identify and
manage risk.

COMPLIANCE RISK

Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition
and resilience arising from violations of laws or regulations, or from
nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures,
or ethical standards. This risk exposes a bank to fines, civil money penalties,
payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk is not
limited to risk from failure to comply with consumer protection laws; it
encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations, as well
as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations. It also includes
the exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all aspects of banking,
traditional and nontraditional.
Compliance risk spans across all risk types in Citi’s risk governance
framework and the risk categories outlined in the Governance, Risk,
Compliance (GRC) taxonomy. Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain
strong ethical standards, and adhere to applicable policies, regulatory and
legal requirements. Citi must maintain and execute a proactive Compliance
Risk Management (CRM) Framework that is designed to change the way in
which compliance risk is managed across Citi, with a view to fundamentally
strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of
defense, taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework and regulatory
requirements. Independent Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) primary
objectives are to:

• Establish, manage and oversee the execution of the CRM Framework

•
•

that facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national or crossborder laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and
procedures and relevant standards of conduct;
Support Citi’s operations by assisting in the management of compliance
risk across products, business lines, functions and geographies, supported
by globally consistent systems and processes; and
Drive and embed a risk culture of compliance, control and ethical
conduct throughout Citi.

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi has established
the CRM Framework to achieve standardization and centralization
of methodologies and processes, and to enable more consistent and
comprehensive execution of compliance risk management.
Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to identify, assess, and
mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions. ICRM
is responsible for Citi’s CRM Framework, while each business and global
control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and
ensure they are operating within the Compliance Risk Appetite.

105

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through
the integrated CRM Framework, which is based upon four components:
(i) governance and organization; (ii) compliance risk ethics and conduct
risk; (iii) processes and activities; and (iv) resources and capabilities. To
achieve this, Citi follows the following CRM Framework process steps:

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and
Citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values to its employees,
customers and investors. To support this, Citi has defined a reputational risk
appetite approach. Under this approach, each major business segment has
implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor
and address weaknesses that may result in significant reputational risks. The
approach requires that each business segment or region escalate significant
reputational risks that require review or mitigation through its business
practice committee or equivalent.
The business practices committees are part of the governance
infrastructure that Citi has in place to properly review business activities,
sales practices, product design, perceived conflicts of interest and other
potential franchise or reputational risks. These committees may also raise
potential franchise, reputational or systemic risks for due consideration
by the business practices committee at the corporate level. All of these
committees, which are composed of Citi’s most senior executives, provide the
guidance necessary for Citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards
of professionalism, integrity and ethical behavior consistent with Citi’s
mission and value proposition.
Further, the responsibility for maintaining Citi’s reputation is shared
by all employees, who are guided by Citi’s code of conduct. Employees are
expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decision and
action. They are also expected to promptly and appropriately escalate all
issues that present potential franchise, reputational and/or systemic risk.

Compliance Risk Appetite. Identifying instances of non-conformance with
Laws, regulations, rules and breaches of internal policies.

governance forums, the results of monitoring, testing, reporting or other
oversight activities that may represent a violation of law, regulation,
policy or other significant compliance risk and take reasonable action
to see that the matter is appropriately identified, tracked and resolved,
including through the issuance of corrective action plans against the first
line of defense.

106

Citi continues to work closely with clients, regulators and other relevant
stakeholders in execution of its plans to prepare for the U.K.’s potential
exit from the EU. In addition, Citi continues to monitor macroeconomic
scenarios and market events and has been undertaking stress testing to assess
potential impacts on its businesses. For additional information, see “Risk
Factors—Strategic Risk” above.

STRATEGIC RISK
Overview

Citi senior management, led by Citi’s CEO, is responsible for the development
and execution of the strategy of the Company. Significant strategic actions
are reviewed and approved by, or notified to, the Citigroup and Citibank
Boards of Directors, as appropriate. The Citigroup Board of Directors holds
an annual strategic meeting and annual regional strategic meetings, and
receives business presentations at its regular meetings, in order to monitor
management’s execution of Citi’s strategy. At the business level, business
heads are accountable for the interpretation and execution of the Companywide strategy, as it applies to their area, including decisions on new business
and product entries.
The management of strategic risk rests upon the foundational elements
that include an annual financial operating plan encompassing all
businesses, products and geographies and defined financial and operating
targets, derived from the operating plan, which can be monitored throughout
the year in order to assess strategic and operating performance. Strategic risk
is monitored through various mechanisms, including regular updates to
senior management and the Board of Directors on performance against the
operating plan, quarterly business reviews between the Citi CEO and business
and regional CEOs in which the performance and risks of each major
business and region are discussed, ongoing reporting to senior management
and executive management scorecards.

LIBOR Transition Risk

Citi recognizes that discontinuance of LIBOR, or any other IBOR-based
rate, presents significant risks and challenges that could have an impact
on its businesses globally (for information about the risks to Citi from
discontinuation of LIBOR or any other benchmark, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risk” above). Accordingly, in 2018, Citi established a LIBOR
governance and implementation program that includes senior management
involvement. Citi’s Asset and Liability Committee oversees the program, and
includes reporting to the Citigroup Board of Directors. The program operates
globally across Citi’s businesses and functions. In addition, Citi has developed
an initial set of LIBOR transition action plans and associated roadmap under
nine key workstreams: transition strategy and risk management; customer
management; internal communications and training; financial exposures
and risk management; regulatory and industry engagement; operations
and technology; finance, tax and treasury; legal and contract management;
and product management. Citi has also been participating in a number
of working groups formed by global regulators, including the Alternative
Reference Rates Committee convened by the Federal Reserve Board. These
working groups have been established to promote and advance development
of alternative reference rates and to identify and address potential challenges
from any transition to such rates.

Potential Exit of U.K. from EU

As a result of a 2016 U.K. referendum, Citi has reorganized certain U.K. and
EU operations and implemented contingency plans to address the U.K.’s
potential exit from the EU, regardless of outcome. In addition, Citi has
established a formal program with senior level sponsorship and governance
to deliver a coordinated response to the U.K.’s potential exit.
Until negotiations are finalized and an agreement is ratified, Citi
continues to plan for a “hard” exit scenario as of March 29, 2019. Citi’s
strategy focuses on providing continuity of services to its EU and U.K. clients
with minimal disruption. Consequently, Citi has been migrating certain
business activities to alternative legal entities and branches with appropriate
regulatory permissions to carry out such activity and establishing required
capabilities in the EU and U.K. Citi’s plans for a U.K. exit from the EU are
well progressed for implementation and primarily cover:

• enhancement of Citi’s European bank in Ireland supported by its
•
•
•

substantial European branch network to ensure business continuity for its
EU clients;
conversion of Citi’s banking subsidiary in Germany into Citi’s EU
investment firm to support broker-dealer activities with EU clients;
establishment of a new U.K. consumer bank to focus on servicing
consumer business clients in the U.K.; and
amendments to existing U.K. legal entities or branches, where required, to
ensure continuity of services to U.K. and non-EU clients.

107

significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more
efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to
the U.K., only 27% of corporate loans presented in the table below are
to U.K. domiciled entities (27% for unfunded commitments), with the
balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties.
Approximately 83% of the total U.K. funded loans and 91% of the total U.K.
unfunded commitments were investment grade as of December 31, 2018.
Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized
based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference
entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the
footnotes to the table below.

Country Risk
Top 25 Country Exposures

The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by country (excluding
the U.S.) as of December 31, 2018. The total exposure as of December 31,
2018 to the top 25 countries disclosed below, in combination with the U.S.,
would represent approximately 96% of Citi’s exposure to all countries.
For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country
where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the
borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based
corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition,
Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most

Venezuela

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local
Country Assets

Citi continues to monitor the political and economic environment and
uncertainties in Venezuela. As of December 31, 2018, Citi’s net investment
in its on-shore Venezuelan operations was approximately $40 million. In
addition, in early 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) sold gold held
at the Bank of England to a Citi entity in the U.K., giving Citi ownership and
full legal title to the gold for $1.6 billion. Simultaneously, the BCV entered
into forward purchase agreements (collectively, the Agreements) with
Citi, requiring the BCV to purchase the same quantity of gold from Citi on
predetermined dates. The next such date will be in March 2019 at which time
the BCV will be required to purchase a significant amount of gold from Citi
under the terms of the Agreements. Citi believes it is protected against market
and credit risk related to the Agreements. The Agreements were accounted for
as a financing on Citi’s books under ASC 470-40.

Citi’s cross-border disclosures are based on the country exposure bank
regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the FFIEC
key reporting guidelines:

• Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor, counterparty,

•

•

•
•

collateral (only including qualifying liquid collateral), issuer or
guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity
but issued by the U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled in Mexico
where the underlying collateral is held in Germany is considered
German exposure).
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured
financing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase
agreements and securities loaned and borrowed) and are reported based
on notional amounts.
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at fair value, is
permitted, but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the
same specific counterparty, and does not include the benefit of margin
received or hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the gross notional
amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting CDS on the
same underlying entity.
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-border exposures
and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in some cases, significantly, from
period to period. As an example, because total outstandings under FFIEC
guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market volatility
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause
significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings, all else being equal.

The tables below show each country whose total outstandings exceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
This section contains a summary of Citi’s most significant accounting
policies and accounting standards that have been issued, but are not
yet effective. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains
a summary of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies, including a
discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements. These policies,
as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of
Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies
require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section
highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require
management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments
and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and
susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above).
Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies,
the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the
Citigroup Board of Directors.

Moreover, for certain investments, decreases in fair value are only
recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such
decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI).
Adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also
inherently judgmental.
The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of
Citi’s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the
quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional
information on Citi’s fair value analysis, see Notes 1, 6, 24 and 25 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses

Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in
the funded loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby
letters of credit on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for loan
losses and in Other liabilities, respectively.
Estimates of these probable losses are based upon (i) Citigroup’s internal
system of credit-risk ratings that are analogous to the risk ratings of the
major credit rating agencies and (ii) historical default and loss data,
including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983
to 2017 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses
in the event of default. Adjustments may be made to this data, including
(i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation
of the default rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss
severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large
obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and (ii) adjustments made
for specifically known items, such as current environmental factors and
credit trends.
In addition, representatives from both the risk management and finance
staffs who cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios
containing smaller balance homogeneous loans present their recommended
reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators, including loan
delinquencies and changes in portfolio size, as well as economic trends,
including housing prices, unemployment and GDP. This methodology is
applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region
in which these portfolios exist.
This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.
The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and
diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign
currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt
servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this review.
Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on Citi’s credit costs
and the allowance in any period.
For a further description of the loan loss reserve and related accounts, see
Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuations of Financial Instruments

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in
securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments.
Substantially all of these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on
Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos) and
sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a majority of which
are carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings,
long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and
loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value.
Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale
and repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet
customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private
equity investing.
When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine
fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy
established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed
valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or
independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency
rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted
cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated
valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or
value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be
classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be
some significant inputs that are readily observable.
Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the
applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance
of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree
of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets.
These judgments have the potential to impact the Company’s financial
performance for instruments where the changes in fair value are recognized
in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI.

111

capitalization due to several factors. The market capitalization of Citigroup
reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving Citigroup due to its size.
However, the individual reporting units’ fair values are not subject to the
same level of execution risk nor a business model that is perceived to be as
complex. In addition, the market capitalization of Citigroup does not include
consideration of the individual reporting unit’s control premium.
See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on goodwill, including the changes in the goodwill
balance year-over-year and the reporting units’ goodwill balances as of
December 31, 2018.

Goodwill

Citi tests goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 (the annual test) and
interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying amount, such as a significant adverse change in the
business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion
of a reporting unit or a significant decline in Citi’s stock price. During 2018,
the annual test was performed, which resulted in no goodwill impairment as
described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2018, Citigroup’s activities are conducted through
the Global Consumer Banking and Institutional Clients Group business
segments and Corporate/Other. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at
the level below the business segment (referred to as a reporting unit).
Citi utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The allocated
equity in the reporting units is determined based on the capital the business
would require if it were operating as a standalone entity, incorporating
sufficient capital to be in compliance with both current and expected
regulatory capital requirements, including capital for specifically identified
goodwill and intangible assets. The capital allocated to the businesses is
incorporated into the annual budget process, which is approved by Citi’s
Board of Directors.
Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring
an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be
supported by the fair value of the reporting unit using widely accepted
valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings multiples and/
or transaction multiples) and/or the income approach (discounted cash flow
(DCF) method). In applying these methodologies, Citi utilizes a number of
factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic
projections and market data.
Similar to 2017, Citigroup engaged an independent valuation specialist
in 2018 to assist in Citi’s valuation for all the reporting units with goodwill
balances, employing both the market approach and the DCF method. The
resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was
given to outputs from both methods.
The DCF method utilized at the time of each impairment test used
discount rates that Citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty
in the financial markets in the internally generated cash flow projections.
The DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the
discount rate.
Since none of the Company’s reporting units are publicly traded,
individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly
correlated to Citigroup’s common stock price. The sum of the fair values
of the reporting units exceeded the overall market capitalization of Citi as
of July 1, 2018. However, Citi believes that it is not meaningful to reconcile
the sum of the fair values of the Company’s reporting units to its market

Income Taxes

Overview
Citi is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and local
municipalities and the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which Citi operates. These
tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the
taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Disputes over
interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by
the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the
taxing authority upon audit.
In establishing a provision for income tax expense, Citi must make
judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently
complex tax laws. Citi must also make estimates about when in the future
certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both
domestic and foreign. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences
of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax
returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets (DTAs)
are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikely-than-not.
On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(Tax Reform), reflecting changes to U.S. corporate taxation, including a
lower statutory tax rate of 21%, a quasi-territorial regime and a deemed
repatriation of all accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries.
The new law was generally effective January 1, 2018.
Citi recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to continuing operations of
$22.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, composed of (i) a $12.4 billion
remeasurement due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate and the
change to a “quasi-territorial tax system,” (ii) a $7.9 billion valuation
allowance against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related
to its non-U.S. branches and (iii) a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC
carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of this one-time charge, $16.4 billion was considered
provisional pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118.

112

Citi completed its accounting for Tax Reform under SAB 118 during the
fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of
$94 million in Corporate/Other, related to amounts that were considered
provisional pursuant to SAB 118.
The table below details the fourth quarter of 2018 changes to Citi’s
provisional impact from Tax Reform.

In billions of dollars

Citi has an overall domestic loss (ODL) of approximately $47 billion. An
ODL allows a company to recharacterize domestic income as income from
sources outside the U.S., which enables a taxpayer to use FTC carry-forwards
and FTCs generated in future years, assuming the generation of sufficient
U.S. taxed income. The change in Tax Reform to allow a taxpayer to elect
to recharacterize up to 100% of its domestic source income as non-U.S.
source income (up from 50%) is not expected to materially impact the
valuation allowance.
As a result of Tax Reform, beginning in 2018, Citi is taxed on income
generated by its U.S. operations at a federal tax rate of 21%. The effect on its
state tax rate is dependent upon how and when the individual states choose
to or automatically adopt the various new provisions of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code.
Citi’s non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries are subject to tax at their local
tax rates. While non-U.S. branches continue to be subject to U.S. taxation,
Citi expects no material residual U.S. tax on such earnings since its overall
non-U.S. branch tax rate is in excess of 21%. With respect to non-U.S.
subsidiaries, dividends from these subsidiaries will be excluded from U.S.
taxation. While the majority of Citi’s non-U.S. subsidiary earnings are
classified as Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), Citi similarly
expects no material residual U.S. tax on such earnings based on its non-U.S.
subsidiaries’ local tax rates, which exceed, on average, the GILTI tax rate.
Finally, Citi does not expect the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) to
affect its tax provision. For additional information on the BEAT, see “Risk
Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

DTAs
At December 31, 2018, Citi had net DTAs of $22.9 billion. In the fourth
quarter of 2018, Citi’s DTAs decreased $0.1 billion, driven primarily by
gains in AOCI. On a full-year basis, Citi’s DTAs increased $0.4 billion from
$22.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in total DTAs year-over-year
was primarily due to the accounting change for Intra-Entity Transfers of
Assets under ASU 2016-16.
Citi’s total valuation allowance at December 31, 2018 was $9.3 billion, a
decrease of $0.1 billion from $9.4 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease
was driven by a reduction due to the SAB 118 adjustment, partially offset by
the 2018 change in DTAs relating to Citi’s non-U.S. branches.
Citi’s valuation allowance of $6.0 billion against FTC carry-forwards
increased by $0.3 billion in 2018. The increase primarily relates to its nonU.S. branches, partially offset by SAB 118 adjustments. Citi expects that the
absolute amount will increase in future years as it generates additional FTCs
relating to the higher overall local tax rate of its non-U.S. branches, reduced
by the statutory expiration of FTC carry-forwards. With respect to the portion
of the valuation allowance established on Citi’s FTC carry-forwards that are
available for use in the general basket, changes in the amount of earnings
from sources outside the U.S. could alter the amount of valuation allowance
that is eventually needed against such FTCs.
Recognized FTCs comprised approximately $6.8 billion of Citi’s DTAs
as of December 31, 2018, compared to approximately $7.6 billion as of
December 31, 2017. The decrease in FTCs year-over-year was primarily due to
adjustments under SAB 118 and current-year usage. The FTC carry-forward
periods represent the most time-sensitive component of Citi’s DTAs.

113

Citi believes the U.S. federal and New York State and City net operating loss
carry-forward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the net
DTAs pertaining to the existing net operating loss carry-forwards. This is due
to Citi’s forecast of sufficient U.S. taxable income and the continued taxation
of Citi’s non-U.S. income by New York State and City. Although realization
is not assured, Citi believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs
of $22.9 billion at December 31, 2018 is more-likely-than-not, based upon
management’s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions
in which the DTAs arise, as well as available tax planning strategies (as
defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes). Citi has concluded that it has the
necessary positive evidence to support the realization of its net DTAs after
taking its valuation allowances into consideration.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Accounting for Financial Instruments—Credit Losses

Lease Accounting

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU
introduces a new credit loss methodology, the Current Expected Credit Losses
(CECL) methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses,
while also providing additional transparency about credit risk.
The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss”
measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-tomaturity debt securities and other receivables measured at amortized cost
at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The allowance for
credit losses is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit
losses. This methodology replaces the multiple existing impairment methods
in current GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is
recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the ASU
will generally result in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit
losses and the related allowance for credit losses than current practice. For
available-for-sale debt securities that Citi intends to hold and where fair
value is less than cost, credit-related impairment, if any, will be recognized
through an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes
in credit risk.
The CECL methodology represents a significant change from existing
GAAP and may result in material changes to the Company’s accounting for
financial instruments. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 201613 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
The impact of the ASU will depend upon the state of the economy, forecasted
macroeconomic conditions and Citi’s portfolios at the date of adoption.
Based on a preliminary analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2018
and forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time, the
overall impact was estimated to be an approximate 10% to 20% increase in
expected credit loss reserves. The ASU will be effective for Citi as of January 1,
2020. This increase would be reflected as a decrease to opening Retained
earnings, net of income taxes, at January 1, 2020.
Implementation efforts are underway, including model development,
fulfillment of additional data needs for new disclosures and reporting
requirements, and drafting of accounting policies. Substantial progress has
been made in model development. Model validations and user acceptance
testing commenced in the first quarter of 2019, with parallel runs to begin
in the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to utilize a single
macroeconomic scenario in estimating expected credit losses. Reasonable
and supportable forecast periods and methods to revert to historical averages
to arrive at lifetime expected credit losses vary by product.
For additional information on regulatory capital treatment, see “Capital
Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Implementation and
Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Methodology” above.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),
which is intended to increase transparency and comparability of accounting
for lease transactions. The ASU will require lessees to recognize leases on
the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and will require
both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information
about leasing arrangements. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. On
January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance prospectively with a
cumulative adjustment to Retained earnings. At adoption, Citi recognized
a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset, related to its future
minimum lease commitments of approximately $4.4 billion. Additionally,
the Company recorded a $155 million increase in Retained earnings due
to the cumulative effect of recognizing previously deferred gains on sale/
leaseback transactions.
Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill
and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
The ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by
eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill
(i.e., the current Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test) to measure a
goodwill impairment charge. Under the ASU, the impairment test is the
comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (the
current Step 1), with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value
but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies to all reporting units
(including those with zero or negative carrying amounts).
The ASU will be effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020. The impact of
the ASU will depend upon the performance of Citi’s reporting units and
the market conditions impacting the fair value of each reporting unit
going forward.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
“Accounting Changes.”

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including without
limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Citi’s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their
responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness
of Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee
is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and
implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the
supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.
Citi’s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has
evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as
of December 31, 2018 and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have
concluded that at that date Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.

116

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING
Citi’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Citi’s internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Citi’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Citi’s assets, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and that Citi’s receipts and expenditures are made only
in accordance with authorizations of Citi’s management and directors and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Citi’s assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In addition, given Citi’s large size, complex operations and global footprint,
lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time.
Citi’s management assessed the effectiveness of Citigroup’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31,
2018, Citi’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. In addition,
there were no changes in Citi’s internal control over financial reporting
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Citi’s internal control over
financial reporting.
The effectiveness of Citi’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2018 has been audited by KPMG LLP, Citi’s independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report below, which
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Citi’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this Form 10-K, including but not limited to statements
included within the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, are “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, Citigroup also may make
forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the
SEC and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to
analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.
Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts,
but instead represent Citigroup’s and its management’s beliefs regarding
future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe,
expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target,
illustrate, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will,
should, would and could.
Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results
and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from those
included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including, without
limitation, (i) the precautionary statements included within each individual
business’s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and (ii) the
factors listed and described under “Risk Factors” above.
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak
only as to the date they are made and Citi does not undertake to update
forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events
that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM—
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Citigroup Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the
“consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated February 22, 2019
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

New York, New York
February 22, 2019

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM—
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Citigroup Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Citigroup
Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes
(collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1969.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by the Company to assess whether
any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change.
All entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has
involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of
ASC 810. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
detailed information.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Throughout these Notes, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and the “Company” refer to
Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial
statements and Notes to conform to the current period’s presentation.
Principles of Consolidation

Foreign Currency Translation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup
and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in
which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights
or where it exercises control. Entities where the Company holds 20% to
50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant
influence, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries
or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are
accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their
income (loss) is included in Other revenue. Income from investments in
less-than-20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are received.
As discussed in more detail in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest
entities when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains
and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings
and other investments are included in Other revenue.

Assets and liabilities of Citi’s foreign operations are translated from their
respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars using period-end spot
foreign exchange rates. The effects of those translation adjustments are
reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component
of stockholders’ equity, net of any related hedge and tax effects, until realized
upon sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation, at which point
such amounts related to the foreign entity are reclassified into earnings.
Revenues and expenses of Citi’s foreign operations are translated monthly
from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at amounts that
approximate weighted average exchange rates.
For transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency, including transactions denominated in the local
currencies of foreign operations that use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency, the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included
in Principal transactions, along with the related effects of any economic
hedges. Instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures include
foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts and, in certain
instances, designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Foreign operations
in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the U.S. dollar
as their functional currency, with the effects of changes in exchange rates
primarily included in Other revenue.

Citibank

Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary
of Citigroup. Citibank’s principal offerings include consumer finance,
mortgage lending and retail banking (including commercial banking)
products and services; investment banking, cash management and trade
finance; and private banking products and services.

Investment Securities

Investments include fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income
instruments include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as
certain loan-backed and structured securities that are subject to prepayment
risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock.
Fixed income securities are classified and accounted for as follows:

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

An entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets either of the
criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810,
Consolidation, which are (i) the entity has equity that is insufficient to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity has equity investors
that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that
do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or
expected returns.
The Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance
and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity
that could be potentially significant to the VIE (that is, Citi is the primary
beneficiary). In addition to variable interests held in consolidated VIEs,
the Company has variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated
because the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

• Fixed income securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are securities that

•

130

the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity
and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is
included in Interest revenue.
Fixed income securities classified as “available-for-sale” are carried at
fair value with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net
of applicable income taxes and hedges. Interest income on such securities
is included in Interest revenue.

Prior to January 1, 2018, equity securities were classified and accounted for
as follows:

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities

Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities,
derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and
physical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in Note 25 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets that Citigroup has elected
to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans and purchased
guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets.
Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not yet purchased
(short positions) and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain
liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value (as described in
Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets
and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading
assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions
and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses
resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income
on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense
on trading liabilities.
Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market
with related losses reported in Principal transactions. Realized gains
and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in Principal
transactions. Investments in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold,
silver, platinum and palladium) are accounted for as hybrid instruments
containing a debt host contract and an embedded non-financial derivative
instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious metal. The
embedded derivative instrument is separated from the debt host contract and
accounted for at fair value. The debt host contract is carried at fair value
under the fair value option, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity,
credit and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants,
and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset
and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other
conditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet—Offsetting, are met.
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value
of trading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 24 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

• Marketable equity securities classified as “available-for-sale” were carried

•

•

at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity,
net of applicable income taxes and hedges. Dividend income on such
securities was included in Interest revenue.
Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities and certain
investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the
equity method were carried at fair value, since the Company elected to
apply fair value accounting. Changes in fair value of such investments
were recorded in earnings.
Certain non-marketable equity securities were carried at cost.

As of January 1, 2018, equity securities are classified and accounted for
as follows:

• Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in
•

•

fair value recognized in earnings. The available-for-sale category was
eliminated for equity securities.
Non-marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement
alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve
Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that
continue to be carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under
the measurement alternative are carried at cost plus or minus changes
resulting from observed prices for orderly transactions for the identical or
a similar investment of the same issuer.
Certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for
using the equity method are carried at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in earnings, since the Company elected to apply fair
value accounting.

For investments in fixed income securities classified as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale, the accrual of interest income is suspended for investments
that are in default or for which it is likely that future interest payments will
not be made as scheduled.
Investment securities not measured at fair value through earnings,
such as securities held in HTM, AFS or under the new measurement
alternative, are subject to evaluation for impairment as described in Note 13
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Realized gains and losses on
sales of investments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific
identification basis.
The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments
carried at fair value, which are described in Note 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

131

As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Citi has
elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on
such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.
Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of
unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash
flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in loans.
However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from
held-for-investment to HFS, the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related
cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Proceeds from sales
and securitizations of loans.

Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned

Securities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute a sale
of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as
collateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are recorded at the
amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest. As described
in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has
elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing
and lending transactions. Fees paid or received for all securities lending and
borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue
at the contractually specified rate.
The Company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on
a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain
contractual margin protection.
As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value
of securities lending and borrowing transactions.

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the Global
Consumer Banking (GCB) businesses and Corporate/Other.

Repurchase and Resale Agreements

Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies
As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both
open- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90 days contractually past
due. For credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi
generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a result
of OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified
as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more
past due. Also as a result of OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated
bank entities are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification
that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans.
Commercial banking loans are placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it
is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment
of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or
principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due.
Loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower
in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the
modification. The policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status
varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number of
payments (ranging from one to six) is required, while in other cases the loan
is never returned to accrual status. For regulated bank entities, such modified
loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of, or
subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the
restructured terms, and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a
reasonable period of sustained payment performance (minimum six months
of consecutive payments).
For U.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify for
modification is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging
from one to three) must be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities
purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale
(or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are
treated as collateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 25 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply
fair value accounting to the majority of such transactions, with changes
in fair value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair value
accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced
or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has
elected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all repo and reverse
repo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the
contractually specified rate.
Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet—Offsetting:
Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements, are met, repos and
reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under
reverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair value of
securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.
As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value
of repo and reverse repo transactions.
Loans

Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any
unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except that
credit card receivable balances also include accrued interest and fees. Loan
origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred
and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans.

current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer
loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans
subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be re-aged
to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly
payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under
FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is
subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years).
Furthermore, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) loans may only be modified under those respective
agencies’ guidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-age
a modified loan to current.

received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability
of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded
investment in the loan.
Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that
principal is deemed to be uncollectable. Impaired collateral-dependent
loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by
the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and
reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying
value or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual status
when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured
of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in
accordance with the contractual terms.

Consumer Charge-Off Policies
Citi’s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:

Loans Held-for-Sale
Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified
as loans HFS and included in Other assets. The practice of Citi’s U.S. prime
mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans.
As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the
fair value option is elected at origination, with changes in fair value recorded
in Other revenue. With the exception of those loans for which the fair value
option has been elected, HFS loans are accounted for at the lower of cost
or market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged
to Other revenue. The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category
on the line Change in loans held-for-sale.

• Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120 days contractually
past due.

• Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at

180 days contractually past due.
Loans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down to
the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days
contractually past due.
Real estate-secured loans are written down to the estimated value of the
property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due.
Real estate-secured loans are charged off no later than 180 days
contractually past due if a decision has been made not to foreclose on
the loans.
Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 60 days of
notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi’s
charge-off policy, whichever occurs earlier.
Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans,
are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell,
within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or
in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever is earlier.
Commercial banking loans are written down to the extent that principal is
judged to be uncollectable.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable
losses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses related to large
individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings.
Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and
the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent
in the overall portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made through the
Provision for loan losses. Loan losses are deducted from the allowance and
subsequent recoveries are added. Assets received in exchange for loan claims
in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss
reflected as a recovery or charge-off in the provision.
Consumer Loans
For consumer loans, each portfolio of non-modified smaller-balance
homogeneous loans is independently evaluated for impairment by product
type (e.g., residential mortgage, credit card, etc.) in accordance with
ASC 450, Contingencies. The allowance for loan losses attributed to these
loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent
in the specific portfolio. This process includes migration analysis, in which
historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current
aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current and

Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by Institutional Clients
Group (ICG). Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a
cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience
and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that
the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal
is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the
process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and
leases is reversed at 90 days past due and charged against current earnings,
and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually

133

anticipated economic conditions, including changes in housing prices and
unemployment trends. Citi’s allowance for loan losses under ASC 450 only
considers contractual principal amounts due, except for credit card loans,
where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are
also included.
Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, including
historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing and classified loans,
trends in volumes and terms of loans, an evaluation of overall credit quality,
the credit process, including lending policies and procedures, and economic,
geographical, product and other environmental factors.
Separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired
smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a
troubled debt restructuring (TDR). Long-term modification programs, and
short-term (less than 12 months) modifications that provide concessions
(such as interest rate reductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty, are
reported as TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that involve a trial
period are reported as TDRs at the start of the trial period. The allowance
for loan losses for TDRs is determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35,
Receivables—Subsequent Measurement, considering all available evidence,
including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s original contractual effective rate, the secondary
market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs.
These expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate
assumptions. The original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is
the pre-modification rate, which may include interest rate increases under
the original contractual agreement with the borrower.
Valuation allowances for commercial banking loans, which are
classifiably managed consumer loans, are determined in the same manner
as for corporate loans and are described in more detail in the following
section. Generally, an asset-specific component is calculated under
ASC 310-10-35 on an individual basis for larger-balance, non-homogeneous
loans that are considered impaired, and the allowance for the remainder
of the classifiably managed consumer loan portfolio is calculated under
ASC 450 using a statistical methodology that may be supplemented by
management adjustment.

The allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is determined under
ASC 450 using a statistical methodology, supplemented by management
judgment. The statistical analysis considers the portfolio’s size, remaining
tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to
individual credit facilities, which reflect probability of default and loss
given default. The statistical analysis considers historical default rates
and historical loss severity in the event of default, including historical
average levels and historical variability. The result is an estimated range
for inherent losses. The best estimate within the range is then determined
by management’s quantitative and qualitative assessment of current
conditions, including general economic conditions, specific industry and
geographic trends and internal factors including portfolio concentrations,
trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past
underwriting standards.
For both the asset-specific and the statistically based components of the
Allowance for loan losses, management may incorporate guarantor support.
The financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated, as applicable,
based on net worth, cash flow statements and personal or company financial
statements, which are updated and reviewed at least annually. Citi seeks
performance on guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business.
Seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the
guarantor or borrower in the specific situation. This regular cooperation
is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee; the
exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal
remedy. A guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work with Citigroup
are evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and
the knowledge of the marketplace. In the rare event that the guarantor
is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation, Citi
pursues a legal remedy; however, enforcing a guarantee via legal action
against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled
loan situation and rarely occurs. If Citi does not pursue a legal remedy,
it is because Citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial
wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are
legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure.
A guarantor’s reputation does not impact Citi’s decision or ability to seek
performance under the guarantee.
In cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses, it
is included via adjustment to the loan’s internal risk rating, which in turn
is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the
Allowance for loan losses. To date, it is only in rare circumstances that an
impaired commercial loan or commercial real estate loan is carried at a
value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee.
When Citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor’s
wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated, there is either no
change in the risk rating, because the guarantor’s credit support was never
initially factored in, or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty
or deterioration. Accordingly, a guarantor’s ultimate failure to perform or

Corporate Loans
In the corporate portfolios, the Allowance for loan losses includes
an asset-specific component and a statistically based component.
The asset-specific component is calculated under ASC 310-10-35 for
larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans that are considered impaired.
An asset-specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows,
collateral value (less disposal costs) or observable market price of the
impaired loan are lower than its carrying value. This allowance considers
the borrower’s overall financial condition, resources and payment record, the
prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors (discussed
further below) and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral.
The asset-specific component of the allowance for smaller-balance impaired
loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience.

134

a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact
the allowance for loan losses, as there is typically no further significant
adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time. Where Citi is not seeking
performance under the guarantee contract, it provides for loan losses as if the
loans were non-performing and not guaranteed.

credit cycle, the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans
and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global
portfolio and (ii) adjustments made for specific known items, such as current
environmental factors and credit trends.
In addition, representatives from each of the risk management and
finance staffs that cover business areas with delinquency-managed
portfolios containing smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their
recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators, including
loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends,
including current and future housing prices, unemployment, length of time
in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately
for each individual product within each geographic region in which these
portfolios exist.
This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.
The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and
diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign
currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt
servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this review.
Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in
any period and could result in a change in the allowance.

Reserve Estimates and Policies
Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent
in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the
form of an allowance for loan losses. These reserves are established in
accordance with Citigroup’s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit
Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and
Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each
quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs
for each applicable business area. Applicable business areas include those
having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit-risk ratings
are assigned (primarily ICG and GCB) or modified consumer loans, where
concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties.
The aforementioned representatives for these business areas present
recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending
portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data
discussed below:

Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments
A similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for
calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded lending
commitments and standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified
on the balance sheet in Other liabilities. Changes to the allowance for
unfunded lending commitments are recorded in Provision for unfunded
lending commitments.

Estimated probable losses for non-performing, non-homogeneous
exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and
impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been
modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties, where it was
determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration
may be given to the following, as appropriate, when determining this
estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan’s original effective rate, (ii) the borrower’s overall financial condition,
resources and payment record and (iii) the prospects for support from
financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral.
In the determination of the allowance for loan losses for TDRs, management
considers a combination of historical re-default rates, the current economic
environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting
expected cash flows. When impairment is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows, the entire change in present value is
recorded in Provision for loan losses.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)

Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets
when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired
through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans.
Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in
value recorded in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement
of Income.
For additional information on the Company’s MSRs, see Notes 16 and 21
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill
is subject to annual impairment testing and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, the
Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is
necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the
totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not

Statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed
portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing exposures.
The calculation is based on (i) Citi’s internal system of credit-risk ratings,
which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies, and
(ii) historical default and loss data, including rating agency information
regarding default rates from 1983 to 2017 and internal data dating to the
early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default. Adjustments may
be made to this data. Such adjustments include (i) statistically calculated
estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the

135

more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company
determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company must perform the
first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.
The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative
assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed
directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual
reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of
the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill is
considered not impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying
value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, this is an indication of
potential impairment and the second step of testing is performed to measure
the amount of impairment, if any, for that reporting unit.
If required, the second step involves calculating the implied fair value
of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units. The implied fair value
of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of
the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets
and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired.
If the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the
implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation,
an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. A recognized impairment
charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit
and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting
unit recovers.
Upon any business disposition, goodwill is allocated to, and derecognized
with, the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed
business to the fair value of the reporting unit.
Additional information on Citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found
in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets include, among other items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets,
equity method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and
equipment (including purchased and developed software), repossessed assets
and other receivables. Other liabilities include, among other items, accrued
expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities and reserves for legal
claims, taxes, unfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves and
other matters.
Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets

Real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are
generally reported in Other assets, net of a valuation allowance for selling
costs and subsequent declines in fair value.
Securitizations

There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating
to securitizations. Citi first makes a determination as to whether the
securitization entity must be consolidated. Second, it determines whether
the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP.
If the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is
the primary beneficiary (as discussed in “Variable Interest Entities” above).
For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which
Citigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party has voting
control of the entity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights
in certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities controlled by
Citigroup are consolidated.
Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form
of subordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated tranches,
spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the
Company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred
to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In the case of consolidated
securitization entities, including the credit card trusts, these retained interests
are not reported on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans
remain on the balance sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold
or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime
residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, except for
MSRs, which are included in Intangible assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets—including core deposit intangibles, present value of
future profits, purchased credit card relationships, credit card contract
related intangibles, other customer relationships and other intangible assets,
but excluding MSRs—are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily
trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests.
An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible
asset exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to amortization,
an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and
exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.

Debt

Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized
cost, except where the Company has elected to report the debt instruments,
including certain structured notes at fair value, or the debt is in a fair value
hedging relationship.

136

Plans), Citigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets
and periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The effect of
remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and assets by updating plan
actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and periodic plan expense. All other plans
(All Other Plans) are remeasured annually. See Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Transfers of Financial Assets

For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale: (i) the assets
must be legally isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other
receivership, (ii) the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets
transferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage
in securitization and asset-backed financing activities through the issuance
of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets
it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge
their beneficial interests) and (iii) the Company may not have an option or
obligation to reacquire the assets.
If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not
met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as
the Company’s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for
complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement
with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer
to be eligible for sale accounting, that opinion must state that the asset
transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would
not be consolidated with the Company’s other assets in the event of the
Company’s insolvency.
For a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale,
the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest.
A participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire
financial asset; all cash flows must be divided proportionately, with the
same priority of payment; no participating interest in the transferred asset
may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder,
and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial
asset unless all participating interest holders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is
accounted for as a secured borrowing.
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and
option awards over the requisite service period, generally based on the
instruments’ grant-date fair value, reduced by actual forfeitures as they
occur. Compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who
meet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-eligible
employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant date, in the same manner
as the accrual for cash incentive compensation. Certain stock awards
with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to
variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated compensation expense
fluctuates with changes in Citigroup’s common stock price. See Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and its states and
municipalities, as well as the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates.
These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations
by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In
establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make
judgments and interpretations about these tax laws. The Company must also
make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable
income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.
Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and
adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions, or may be
settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company
treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of Income
tax expense.
Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that
have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns, based upon
enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to
management’s judgment about whether realization is more-likely-than-not.
ASC 740, Income Taxes, sets out a consistent framework to determine the
appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions.
This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is
recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount
of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is more than
50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to
enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further
description of the Company’s tax provision and related income tax assets
and liabilities.

Risk Management Activities—Derivatives Used for
Hedging Purposes

The Company manages its exposures to market movements outside of its
trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly
or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest rate
swaps, futures, forwards and purchased options, as well as foreign-exchange
contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Trading
account assets and Trading account liabilities.
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further
discussion of the Company’s hedging and derivative activities.
Employee Benefits Expense

Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and
other postretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current basis),
contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the
amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits.
For its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant

Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Commissions and fees revenues are recognized in income when earned.
Underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of
the transaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized in income
on a trade-date basis. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies for Commissions
and fees, and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of
Principal transactions revenue.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118

On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118,
which set forth the accounting for the changes in tax law caused by the
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). SAB 118 provided
guidance where the accounting under ASC 740 was incomplete for certain
income tax effects of Tax Reform, at the time of the issuance of an entity’s
financial statements for the period in which Tax Reform was enacted
(provisional items). Citi disclosed several provisional items recorded as part
of its $22.6 billion fourth quarter 2017 charge related to Tax Reform.
Citi completed its accounting for Tax Reform under SAB 118 during the
fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of
$94 million in Corporate/Other related to amounts that were considered
provisional pursuant to SAB 118. The adjustments related to the provisional
amounts consisted of a $1.2 billion benefit relating to a reduction of the
valuation allowance against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards and its U.S. residual
DTAs related to its non-U.S. branches, offset by an additional $0.2 billion
charge related to the impact of a change to a “quasi-territorial tax system”
and an additional $0.9 billion charge related to the impact of deemed
repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Also, Citi has made a policy election to account for taxes on GILTI
as incurred.

Earnings per Share

Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting preferred stock
dividends. The Company has granted restricted and deferred share awards
with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities,
which are akin to a second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion
of Citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the
EPS calculation.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed
earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is computed after giving
consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company’s stock
options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of
earnings to the participating securities. Anti-dilutive options and warrants are
disregarded in the EPS calculations.

Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Revenue Recognition), which outlines a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts
with customers. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity
recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU
defines the promised good or service as the performance obligation under
the contract.
While the guidance replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance
in GAAP, the ASU is not applicable to financial instruments and, therefore,
does not impact a majority of the Company’s revenues, including net interest
income, loan fees, gains on sales and mark-to-market accounting.
In accordance with the new revenue recognition standard, Citi has
identified the specific performance obligation (promised services) associated
with the contract with the customer and has determined when that specific
performance obligation has been satisfied, which may be at a point in time
or over time depending on how the performance obligation is defined.
The contracts with customers also contain the transaction price, which
consists of fixed consideration and/or consideration that may vary (variable
consideration), and is defined as the amount of consideration an entity
expects to be entitled to when or as the performance obligation is satisfied,
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (including transaction
taxes). The amounts recognized at the point in time the performance
obligation is satisfied may differ from the ultimate transaction price
associated with that performance obligation when a portion of it is based
on variable consideration. For example, some consideration is based on the
client’s month-end balance or market values which are unknown at the time

Use of Estimates

Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Such estimates are used in connection with certain
fair value measurements. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination
of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the
amounts of other-than-temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill
and other intangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may arise
from credit-related exposures and probable and estimable losses related to
litigation and regulatory proceedings, and income taxes. While management
makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from
those estimates.
Cash Flows

Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due
from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks. Cash flows from
risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related
assets and liabilities.
Related Party Transactions

The Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries
and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature,
include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin
accounts, derivative transactions, charges for operational support and the
borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course
of business.

138

acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar
identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a
business. If the set is not scoped out from the quantitative screen, the entity
then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include,
at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs.
Citi adopted the ASU upon its effective date on January 1, 2018,
prospectively. The ongoing impact of the ASU will depend upon the
acquisition and disposal activities of Citi. If fewer transactions qualify as a
business, there could be less initial recognition of Goodwill, but also less
goodwill allocated to disposals. There was no impact during 2018 from the
adoption of this ASU.

the contract is executed. The remaining transaction price amount, if any, will
be recognized as the variable consideration becomes determinable. In certain
transactions, the performance obligation is considered satisfied at a point in
time in the future. In this instance, Citi defers revenue on the balance sheet
that will only be recognized upon completion of the performance obligation.
The new revenue recognition standard further clarified the guidance
related to reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent. In
many cases, Citi outsources a component of its performance obligations to
third parties. The Company has determined that it acts as principal in the
majority of these transactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to
these third parties gross within operating expenses.
The Company has retrospectively adopted this standard as of January 1,
2018 and as a result was required to report amounts paid to third parties
where Citi is principal to the contract within Operating expenses.
The adoption resulted in an increase in both revenue and expenses of
approximately $1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017 with similar amounts for prior years. Prior to adoption, these
expense amounts were reported as contra revenue primarily within
Commissions and fees and Administration and other fiduciary fees
revenues. Accordingly, prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
new presentation.
See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of
the Company’s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and fees and
Administration and other fiduciary fees.

Changes in Accounting for Pension and Postretirement
(Benefit) Expense

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—
Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,
which changes the income statement presentation of net benefit expense and
requires restating the Company’s financial statements for each of the earlier
periods presented in Citi’s annual and interim financial statements. The
change in presentation was effective for annual and interim periods starting
January 1, 2018. The ASU requires that only the service cost component of net
benefit expense be included in Compensation and benefits on the income
statement. The other components of net benefit expense are required to be
presented outside of Compensation and benefits and are presented in Other
operating expenses. Since both of these income statement line items are
part of Operating expenses, total Operating expenses and Net income will
not change. This change in presentation did not have a material effect on
Compensation and benefits and Other operating expenses and is applied
prospectively. The components of the net benefit expense are currently
disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The new standard also changes the components of net benefit expense
that are eligible for capitalization when employee costs are capitalized in
connection with various activities, such as internally developed software,
construction-in-progress and loan origination costs. Prospectively from
January 1, 2018, only the service cost component of net benefit expense may
be capitalized. Existing capitalized balances are not affected. This change
in amounts eligible for capitalization does not have a material effect on the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

Income Tax Impact of Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes—
Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an
entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of
an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU was effective
January 1, 2018 and was adopted as of that date. The impact of this standard
was an increase of DTAs by approximately $300 million, a decrease of
Retained earnings by approximately $80 million and a decrease of prepaid
tax assets by approximately $380 million.
Clarifying the Definition of a Business

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations
(Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The definition
of a business directly and indirectly affects many areas of accounting
(e.g., acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation). The ASU narrows
the definition of a business by introducing a quantitative screen as the
first step, such that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets

139

under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. Finally,
the ASUs require that fair value disclosures for financial instruments not
measured at fair value on the balance sheet be presented at their exit prices
(e.g., held-for-investment loans).
Citi early adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-01 related to presentation
of the change in fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was
elected, related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads in Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) effective January 1, 2016.
Accordingly, these amounts have been reflected as a component of AOCI,
whereas these amounts were previously recognized in Citigroup’s revenues
and net income. The impact of adopting this amendment resulted in a
cumulative catch-up reclassification from Retained earnings to AOCI of an
accumulated after-tax loss of approximately $15 million at January 1, 2016.
Financial statements for periods prior to 2016 were not subject to restatement
under the provisions of this ASU. For additional information, see Notes 19, 24
and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Citi adopted the other provisions of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-03 as of
January 1, 2018. Accordingly, as of the first quarter of 2018, the changes to
accounting for equity securities and fair value disclosures have been reflected
in Citigroup’s financial statements. The impact of adopting the change
to AFS equity securities resulted in a cumulative catch-up reclassification
from AOCI to Retained earnings of an accumulated after-tax gain of
approximately $3 million at January 1, 2018. Citi elected the measurement
alternative for all non-marketable equity investments that no longer qualify
for cost measurement under the ASUs. This provision in the ASUs was adopted
prospectively. Financial statements for periods prior to 2018 were not subject
to restatement under the provisions of the ASUs. For additional information,
see Notes 13, 19 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension Accounting

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Defined Benefit Plans
(Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. The amendments modify certain
disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans and are effective January 1,
2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU as of
December 31, 2018 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company.
Hedging

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements
to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which better aligns an entity’s risk
management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships
through changes to the designation and measurement guidance for
qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The
ASU requires the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be
presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item and also
requires expanded disclosures. Citi adopted this standard on January 1,
2018 and transferred approximately $4 billion of pre-payable mortgagebacked securities and municipal bonds from held-to-maturity (HTM) into
available-for-sale (AFS) securities classification as permitted as a one-time
transfer upon adoption of the standard, as these assets were deemed to be
eligible to be hedged under the last-of-layer hedge strategy. The impact to
opening Retained earnings was immaterial. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information.
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which
addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of financial instruments. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial
Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10), to clarify certain provisions in
ASU 2016-01.
The ASUs require entities to present separately in AOCI the portion of the
total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the
liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial
instruments. The ASUs also require equity investments (except those
accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in
consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in net income, thus eliminating the AFS category for
equity investments. However, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan
Bank stock, as well as certain exchange seats, will continue to be presented at
cost. The ASUs also provide an instrument-by-instrument election to measure
non-marketable equity investments using a measurement alternative.
Under the measurement alternative, the investment is carried at cost plus
or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions
for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Equity securities

Statement of Cash Flows

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash,
which requires that companies present cash, cash equivalents and amounts
generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents (restricted
cash) when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period totals
on the Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with the adoption of the
ASU, Citigroup also changed its definition of cash and cash equivalents
to include all of Cash and due from banks and predominately all of
Deposits with banks. The Company has retrospectively adopted this ASU
as of January 1, 2018 and as a result Net cash provided by investing
activities of continuing operations on the Statement of Cash Flows for the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 increased by $19.3 billion and
$25.3 billion, respectively.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which provides guidance on
the classification and presentation of certain cash receipts and payments on
the Statement of Cash Flows. The Company has retrospectively adopted this
ASU as of January 1, 2018, which resulted in immaterial changes to Citi’s
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting in order to simplify certain complex aspects of the
accounting for income taxes and forfeitures related to employee stock-based
compensation. The guidance became effective for Citi beginning on
January 1, 2017. Under the new standard, excess tax benefits and deficiencies
related to employee stock-based compensation are recognized directly within
income tax expense or benefit in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of Income,
rather than within additional paid-in capital. The impact of this change was
not material in the first quarter of 2017 or each subsequent quarterly period
of 2017 as the majority of employees’ deferred stock-based compensation
awards are granted within the first quarter of each year and, therefore, vest
within the first quarter of each year, commensurate with vesting in equal
annual installments. For additional information on these receivables and
payables, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, as permitted under the new guidance, Citi made an
accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur,
which represents a change from the previous requirement to estimate
forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense. This change resulted in
a cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings that was not material
at January 1, 2017.

On February 14, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects
from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU allows a
reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
(AOCI) to Retained earnings for the deferred taxes previously recorded in
AOCI that exceed the current federal tax rate of 21% resulting from the newly
enacted corporate tax rate in Tax Reform and other stranded tax amounts
related to the application of Tax Reform that Citi elects to reclassify. The ASU
allows adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a
result of changes to the amounts recorded under SAB 118. Citi elected to early
adopt the ASU effective December 31, 2017, which affected only the period
that the effects related to the one-time Tax Reform charge were recognized.
In addition to the reclassification of deferred taxes recorded in AOCI that
exceed the current federal tax rate, Citi also reclassified amounts recorded
in AOCI related to the effects of the shift to a territorial system related to the
application of Tax Reform using the portfolio method.
The effect of adopting the ASU resulted in an increase of $3.3 billion to
Retained earnings at December 31, 2017 due to the reclassification of AOCI
to Retained earnings.
Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable
Debt Securities

Fair Value Measurement

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Receivables—
Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which amends the
amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a
premium. The ASU requires entities to amortize premiums on debt securities
by the first call date when the securities have fixed and determinable call
dates and prices. The scope of the ASU includes all accounting premiums,
such as purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments.
The ASU does not change the accounting for discounts, which continue to be
recognized over the contractual life of a security.
Citi early adopted the ASU in the second quarter of 2017, with an effective
date of January 1, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is on a modified retrospective
basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings as of
the beginning of the year of adoption. Adoption of the ASU primarily affected
Citi’s AFS and HTM portfolios of callable state and municipal debt securities.
The ASU adoption resulted in a net reduction to total stockholders’ equity
of $156 million (after-tax), effective as of January 1, 2017. This amount
is composed of a reduction of approximately $660 million to Retained
earnings for the incremental amortization of purchase premiums and
cumulative hedge adjustments generated under fair value hedges of these
callable debt securities, offset by an increase to AOCI of $504 million related
to the cumulative fair value hedge adjustments reclassified to Retained
earnings for AFS debt securities.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments modify
certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and are
effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company early
adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2018 in its entirety. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Company.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND
SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS

Sale of Fixed Income Analytics and Index Business

On August 31, 2017, Citi completed the sale of a fixed income analytics
business and a fixed income index business that were part of Markets and
securities services within Institutional Clients Group (ICG). As part of
the sale, Citi derecognized Total assets of $112 million, including goodwill
of $72 million, while the derecognized liabilities were $18 million. The
transaction resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $580 million
($355 million after-tax) recorded in Other revenue in ICG during 2017.
Income before taxes excluding the pretax gain on sale for the divested
businesses was immaterial for the periods presented.

Summary of Discontinued Operations

The Company’s Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities
related to the sales of the Brazil Credicard business in 2013, the Egg
Banking plc Credit Card Business in 2011 and the German Retail Banking
business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded
within Corporate/Other.

Exit of U.S. Mortgage Service Operations

Citigroup executed agreements during the first quarter of 2017 to effectively
exit its direct U.S. mortgage servicing operations by the end of 2018
to intensify focus on originations. The exit of the mortgage servicing
operations included the sale of mortgage servicing rights and execution of a
subservicing agreement for the remaining Citi-owned loans and certain other
mortgage servicing rights. As part of this transaction, Citi has also transferred
certain employees.
This transaction, which was part of Corporate/Other, resulted in a pretax
loss of $331 million ($207 million after-tax) recorded in Other revenue
during 2017. The loss on sale did not include certain other costs and
charges related to the disposed operation recorded primarily in Operating
expenses during 2017, resulting in a total pretax loss of $382 million. As
part of the sale, Citi derecognized a total of $1,162 million of servicingrelated assets, including $1,046 million of Mortgage servicing rights,
related to approximately 750,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held loans
with outstanding balances of approximately $93 billion. Excluding the loss
on sale and the additional charges, income before taxes for the disposed
operation was immaterial for the periods presented.

Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for all
periods presented.
Significant Disposals

The transactions described below were identified as significant disposals
during 2018, 2017 and 2016. The major classes of Assets and Liabilities
derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at closing, and the
income (loss) before taxes related to each business until the disposal date,
are presented below.
Sale of Mexico Asset Management Business

On September 21, 2018, Citi completed the sale of its Mexico asset
management business, which was part of Latin America GCB. As part of
the sale, Citi derecognized total assets of $137 million, including goodwill of
$32 million, which were classified as held-for-sale beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2017, and total liabilities of $41 million. The transaction resulted
in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $250 million (approximately
$150 million after-tax) recorded in Other revenue in the third quarter of
2018. Further, Citi and the buyer entered into a 10-year services framework
agreement, with Citi acting as the distributor in exchange for an ongoing fee.
Income before taxes, excluding the pretax gain on sale, for the divested
business was as follows:

(CitiFinancial), which was part of Corporate/Other, and included 220
retail branches and approximately 1,400 employees. As part of the sale,
Citi derecognized Total assets of approximately $1.9 billion, including
$1.7 billion consumer loans (net of allowance), and Total liabilities of
approximately $1.5 billion related to intercompany borrowings, which were
settled at closing of the transaction. Separately, during 2017 and prior to
closing of the transaction, CitiFinancial settled $0.4 billion of debt issued
through loan securitizations. The sale of CitiFinancial generated a pretax
gain on sale of approximately $350 million recorded in Other revenue
($178 million after-tax) during 2017.

3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Citigroup’s activities are conducted through the following business segments:
Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group
(ICG). In addition, Corporate/Other includes activities not assigned to a
specific business segment, as well as certain North America loan portfolios,
discontinued operations and other legacy assets.
The business segments are determined based on products and services
provided or type of customers served, of which those identified as non-core
are recorded in Corporate/Other and are reflective of how management
currently evaluates financial information to make business decisions.
GCB includes a global, full-service consumer franchise delivering a
wide array of banking, including commercial banking, credit card lending
and investment services through a network of local branches, offices and
electronic delivery systems and consists of three GCB businesses: North
America, Latin America and Asia (including consumer banking activities
in certain EMEA countries).
ICG consists of Banking and Markets and securities services and
provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients in
98 countries and jurisdictions with a broad range of banking and financial
products and services.

Credit- and bank-card income is primarily composed of interchange fees,
which are earned by card issuers based on purchase sales, and certain card
fees, including annual fees. Costs related to customer reward programs and
certain payments to partners (primarily based on program sales, profitability
and customer acquisitions) are recorded as a reduction of credit- and bankcard income. Interchange revenues are recognized as earned on a daily
basis when Citi’s performance obligation to transmit funds to the payment
networks has been satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are
deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Costs
related to card reward programs are recognized when the rewards are earned
by the cardholders. Payments to partners are recognized when incurred.
Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts and
fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit
account services. Such fees are recognized in the period in which the related
service is provided.
Transactional service fees primarily consist of fees charged for processing
services such as cash management, global payments, clearing, international
funds transfer and other trade services. Such fees are recognized as/when the
associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the
service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi.
Insurance distribution revenue consists of commissions earned from
third-party insurance companies for marketing and selling insurance
policies on behalf of such entities. Such commissions are recognized in
Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled,
generally when the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of
certain insurance products include a portion of variable consideration
associated with the underlying product. In these instances, a portion of the
revenue associated with the sale of the policy is not recognized until the
variable consideration becomes determinable. The Company recognized
$386 million, $440 million and $479 million of revenue related to such
variable consideration for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to performance obligations
in prior periods.
Insurance premiums consist of premium income from insurance policies
that Citi has underwritten and sold to policyholders.

5. COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION AND
OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES

The primary components of Commissions and fees revenue are investment
banking fees, brokerage commissions, credit- and bank-card income and
deposit-related fees.
Investment banking fees are substantially composed of underwriting
and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized at the point in time when
Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is
completed, which is typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed
expenses related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and are
included within investment banking fees. In certain instances for advisory
contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of the deal’s closing. In these
instances, the amounts received will be recognized as a liability and not
recognized in revenue until the transaction closes. The contract liability
amount for the periods presented was negligible. Out-of-pocket expenses
associated with underwriting activity are deferred and recognized at the time
the related revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses associated
with advisory arrangements are expensed as incurred. In general, expenses
incurred related to investment banking transactions, whether consummated
or not, are recorded in Other operating expenses. The Company has
determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and
therefore presents expenses gross within Other operating expenses.
Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions and fees from
the following: executing transactions for clients on exchanges and over-thecounter markets; sales of mutual funds and other annuity products; and
assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and
other such activities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in Commissions
and fees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally
on the trade execution date. Gains or losses, if any, on these transactions
are included in Principal transactions (see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements). Sales of certain investment products include a portion
of variable consideration associated with the underlying product. In these
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of the product is
not recognized until the variable consideration becomes fixed. The Company
recognized $521 million, $416 million and $371 million of revenue related
to such variable consideration for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017
and 2016, respectively. These amounts primarily relate to performance
obligations satisfied in prior periods.

Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and investment management
services. As an escrow agent, Citi receives, safe-keeps, services and manages
clients’ escrowed assets such as cash, securities, property (including
intellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi performs its escrow
agent duties by safekeeping the funds during the specified time period
agreed upon by all parties and therefore earns its revenue evenly during the
contract duration.
Investment management services consist of managing assets on behalf of
Citi’s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from these services primarily
consists of asset-based fees for advisory accounts, which are based on the
market value of the client’s assets and recognized monthly, when the market
value is fixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party
advisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has determined that
it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore presents
the amounts paid to third parties gross within Other operating expenses.
The following table presents Administration and other fiduciary fees:

Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees

Administration and other fiduciary fees are primarily composed of custody
fees and fiduciary fees.
The custody product is composed of numerous services related to the
administration, safekeeping and reporting for both U.S. and non-U.S.
denominated securities. The services offered to clients include trade
settlement, safekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,
record-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management. These
services are provided for a wide range of securities, including but not limited
to equities, municipal and corporate bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed
securities, money market instruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies,
derivative instruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious
metals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated promised
service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is
requested by the customer and provided by Citi.

participant’s business in the calendar year preceding the scheduled vesting
date. A minimum reduction of 20% applies for the first dollar of loss for CAP
and deferred cash stock unit awards.
In addition, deferred cash awards are subject to a discretionary
performance-based vesting condition under which an amount otherwise
scheduled to vest may be reduced in the event of a “material adverse
outcome” for which a participant has “significant responsibility.” These
awards are also subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant
to which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee engaged in
misconduct or exercised materially imprudent judgment, or failed to
supervise or escalate the behavior of other employees who did.

7. INCENTIVE PLANS
Discretionary Annual Incentive Awards

Citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various forms of
immediate and deferred awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive
award program involving a large segment of Citigroup’s employees
worldwide. Most of the shares of common stock issued by Citigroup as part
of its equity compensation programs are to settle the vesting of the stock
components of these awards.
Discretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first
quarter of the year based on the previous year’s performance. Awards valued
at less than U.S. $100,000 (or the local currency equivalent) are generally
paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus. Pursuant to Citigroup
policy and/or regulatory requirements, certain employees and officers are
subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 25%–
60% of their awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock, deferred
cash stock units or deferred cash. Discretionary annual incentive awards to
many employees in the EU are subject to deferral requirements regardless of
the total award value, with at least 50% of the immediate incentive delivered
in the form of a stock payment award subject to a restriction on sale or
transfer (generally, for 12 months).
Deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered in the form of one or
more award types: a restricted or deferred stock award under Citi’s Capital
Accumulation Program (CAP), or a deferred cash stock unit award and/or a
deferred cash award under Citi’s Deferred Cash Award Plan. The applicable
mix of awards may vary based on the employee’s minimum deferral
requirement and the country of employment.
Subject to certain exceptions (principally, for retirement-eligible
employees), continuous employment within Citigroup is required to vest in
CAP, deferred cash stock unit and deferred cash awards. Post employment
vesting by retirement-eligible employees and participants who meet other
conditions is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition
with Citigroup during the remaining vesting period, unless the employment
relationship has been terminated by Citigroup under certain conditions.
Generally, the deferred awards vest in equal annual installments over
three- or four-year periods. Vested CAP awards are delivered in shares of
common stock. Deferred cash awards are payable in cash and, except as
prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, earn a fixed notional rate of
interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal award amount
vests. Deferred cash stock unit awards are payable in cash at the vesting value
of the underlying stock. Generally, in the EU, vested CAP shares are subject
to a restriction on sale or transfer after vesting, and vested deferred cash
awards and deferred cash stock units are subject to hold back (generally, for
12 months in each case).
Unvested CAP, deferred cash stock units and deferred cash awards
are subject to one or more clawback provisions that apply in certain
circumstances, including gross misconduct. CAP and deferred cash stock unit
awards, made to certain employees, are subject to a formulaic performancebased vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise scheduled
to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any pretax loss in the

Sign-on and Long-Term Retention Awards

Stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at various times during
the year as sign-on awards to induce new hires to join Citi or to highpotential employees as long-term retention awards.
Vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining to these
awards tend to vary by grant. Generally, recipients must remain employed
through the vesting dates to vest in the awards, except in cases of death,
disability or involuntary termination other than for gross misconduct.
These awards do not usually provide for post employment vesting by
retirement-eligible participants.

A summary of the performance share unit activity for 2018 is
presented below:

Performance Share Units

Certain executive officers were awarded a target number of performance
share units (PSUs) each February from 2015 to 2018, for performance in the
year prior to the award date. For grants prior to 2016, PSUs will be earned
only to the extent that Citigroup attains specified performance goals relating
to Citigroup’s return on assets and relative total shareholder return against
peers over the three-year period beginning with the year of award. The actual
dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero, if performance
goals are not met, to as much as 150% of target, if performance goals are
meaningfully exceeded.
The PSUs granted in February 2016 are earned over a three-year
performance period based on Citigroup’s relative total shareholder return as
compared to peers. The actual dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary
from zero, if performance goals are not met, to as much as 150% of target, if
performance goals are meaningfully exceeded.
The PSUs granted in February 2017 are earned over a three-year
performance period based half on return on tangible common equity
performance in 2019, and the remaining half on cumulative earnings per
share over 2017 to 2019.
The PSUs granted in February 2018 are earned over a three-year
performance period based half on return on tangible common equity
performance in 2020, and the remaining half on cumulative earnings per
share over 2018 to 2020.
For the PSUs awarded in 2016, 2017 and 2018, if the total shareholder
return is negative over the three-year performance period, executives may
earn no more than 100% of the target PSUs, regardless of the extent to which
Citi outperforms peer firms.
For all award years, the value of each PSU is equal to the value of one
share of Citi common stock. Dividend equivalents will be accrued and paid
on the number of earned PSUs after the end of the performance period.
PSUs are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated
value of the award will fluctuate with changes in Citigroup’s stock price and
the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award, until the
award is settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period. The
value of the award, subject to the performance goals, is estimated using
a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions,
including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of
each award. The risk-free rate used in the model is based on the applicable
U.S. Treasury yield curve. Other significant assumptions for the awards are
as follows:

(1) The weighted-average grant date fair value per unit awarded in 2017 and 2016 was $59.22 and
$27.03, respectively.

PSUs granted in 2015 and 2017 were equitably adjusted after the
enactment of Tax Reform, as required under the terms of those awards. The
adjustments were intended to reproduce the expected value of the awards
immediately prior to the passage of Tax Reform. The PSUs granted in 2016
were not impacted by Tax Reform.
Stock Option Programs

All outstanding stock options are fully vested, with the related expense
recognized as a charge to income in prior periods. Generally, the stock
options outstanding have a six-year term, with some stock options subject to
various transfer restrictions.

receive dividends or dividend-equivalent payments during the vesting period.
Recipients of restricted stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares
in their award during the vesting period. Once a stock award vests, the shares
are freely transferable, unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or
transfer for a specified period.
All equity awards granted since April 19, 2005 have been made pursuant
to stockholder-approved stock incentive plans that are administered by the
Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors,
which is composed entirely of independent non-employee directors.
At December 31, 2018, approximately 42.4 million shares of Citigroup
common stock were authorized and available for grant under Citigroup’s
2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the only plan from which equity awards are
currently granted.
The 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the use of
treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted
under the plans. Treasury shares were used to settle vestings from 2016 to
2018, and for the first quarter of 2019, except where local laws favor newly
issued shares. The use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle
stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Income for equity awards.

Citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and
reward performance primarily in the areas of sales, operational excellence
and customer satisfaction. Participation in these plans is generally limited
to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards.
Other forms of variable compensation include monthly commissions paid to
financial advisors and mortgage loan officers.
Summary

Except for awards subject to variable accounting, the total expense
recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such
awards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the
vesting period, other than for awards to retirement-eligible employees and
immediately vested awards. Whenever awards are made or are expected to be
made to retirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is accelerated
based on when the applicable conditions to retirement eligibility were or will
be met. If the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date, or the award
is vested at the grant date, the entire expense is recognized in the year prior
to grant.
Recipients of Citigroup stock awards generally do not have any
stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting or exercise, or after
the expiration of applicable required holding periods. Recipients of restricted
or deferred stock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards, however,
may, except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, be entitled to

certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula, the
benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years.
The plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense for the
Company’s most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans
(Significant Plans) are measured and disclosed quarterly, instead of
annually. The Significant Plans captured approximately 90% of the
Company’s global pension and postretirement plan obligations as of
December 31, 2018. All other plans (All Other Plans) are measured annually
with a December 31 measurement date.

8. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension and Postretirement Plans

The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans
covering certain U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and
termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the U.S.
The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective January 1,
2008 for most employees. Accordingly, no additional compensation-based
contributions have been credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for
existing plan participants after 2007. However, certain employees covered
under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits. The
Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to
certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees
outside the U.S.
The Company also sponsors a number of non-contributory, nonqualified
pension plans. These plans, which are unfunded, provide supplemental

years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as estimated expected
Company contributions for 2019. Expected contributions are subject to
change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as
market performance, tax considerations and regulatory requirements.

The Company’s funding practice for U.S. and non-U.S. pension and
postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements
in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The Company
may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution, if
appropriate. In addition, management has the ability to change its funding
practices. For the U.S. pension plans, there were no required minimum cash
contributions for 2018 or 2017.

Plan Assumptions

During the year

The Company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan
obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a combination of these
assumptions will have an impact on the Company’s pension and
postretirement PBO, funded status and (benefit) expense. Changes in the
plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the PBO and fair value
of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).
The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended December 31 in
the table below are used to measure the year-end PBO and the net periodic
(benefit) expense for the subsequent year (period). Since Citi’s Significant
Plans are measured on a quarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans
are used to calculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent
year’s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement process, the
net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant Plans is calculated at each
respective quarter end based on the preceding quarter-end rates (as shown
below for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans). The
actuarial assumptions for All Other Plans are measured annually.
Certain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement
benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Company’s plans are
shown in the following table:

The following table shows the expected rates of return used in
determining the Company’s pension expense compared to the actual rate of
return on plan assets during 2018, 2017 and 2016 for the U.S. pension and
postretirement plans:

Discount Rate
The discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were
selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plan’s
specific cash flows and compared with high-quality corporate bond indices
for reasonableness. The discount rates for the non-U.S. pension and
postretirement plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond
rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However,
where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates
are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium
added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries.
The established rounding convention is to the nearest 5 bps for the top five
non-U.S. countries, and 25 bps for all other countries.

(1) In December 2017, the VEBA Trust was funded for postretirement benefits with an expected rate of
return on assets of 3.00%.
(2) Actual rates of return are presented net of fees.

Expected Rate of Return
The Company determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return
on plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a
“building block” approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates
of return for each asset class. A weighted average range of nominal rates
is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class. Market
performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide
range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons
for projecting any past trends.
The Company considers the expected rate of return to be a long-term
assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this
assumption unless there are significant changes in investment strategy
or economic conditions. This contrasts with the selection of the discount
rate and certain other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually (or
quarterly for the Significant Plans) in accordance with GAAP.
The expected rate of return for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans
was 6.70% at December 31, 2018 and 6.80% at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The expected return on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of
the plan assets and reduces the Company’s annual pension expense. The
expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service cost, interest
cost and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension
(benefit) expense. Net pension (benefit) expense for the U.S. pension plans
for 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflects deductions of $844 million, $865 million
and $886 million of expected returns, respectively.

For the non-U.S. pension plans, pension expense for 2018 was reduced by
the expected return of $291 million, compared with the actual return of
$(11) million. Pension expense for 2017 and 2016 was reduced by expected
returns of $299 million and $287 million, respectively.
Mortality Tables
At December 31, 2018, the Company maintained the Retirement Plan
2014 (RP-2014) mortality table and adopted the Mortality Projection 2018
(MP-2018) projection table for the U.S. plans.

Interest Crediting Rate
The Company has cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest
crediting rates. For these plans, the interest crediting rates are set in line with
plan rules or country legislation and do not change with market conditions.

Since the U.S. qualified pension plan was frozen, most of the prospective
service cost has been eliminated and the gain/loss amortization period was
changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants. As a result, pension
expense for the U.S. qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs
than service costs, and an increase in the discount rate would increase
pension expense, while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease
pension expense.

(1) Asset allocations for the U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product. For example, private equities with an underlying investment in real estate are classified in the real estate asset category,
not private equity.
(2) Equity securities in the U.S. pension and postretirement plans do not include any Citigroup common stock at the end of 2018 and 2017.
(3) The VEBA Trust for postretirement benefits are primarily invested in debt securities which are not reflected in the table above.

Third-party investment managers and advisors provide their services to
Citigroup’s U.S. pension and postretirement plans. Assets are rebalanced as
the Company’s Pension Plan Investment Committee deems appropriate.
Citigroup’s investment strategy, with respect to its assets, is to maintain a
globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that,
when combined with Citigroup’s contributions to the plans, will maintain the
plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations.

Citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weighted-average asset

Investment Strategy

Oversight and Risk Management Practices

The Company’s global pension and postretirement funds’ investment strategy
is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing
benefits to participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce
a total return that, when combined with the Company’s contributions
to the funds, will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit
obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and
investments in domestic and international equities, fixed income securities
and cash and short-term investments. The target asset allocation in most
locations outside the U.S. is primarily in equity and debt securities. These
allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the
nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations.
The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the
funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and
economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires
that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments,
government funds or local-country securities.

The framework for the Company’s pension oversight process includes
monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries and/or management
at the global, regional or country level, as appropriate. Independent Risk
Management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the
Company’s U.S. qualified pension plan and non-U.S. Significant Pension
Plans. Although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored
to the requirements of each region, country and plan, the following elements
are common to the Company’s monitoring and risk management process:

• periodic asset/liability management studies and strategic asset
allocation reviews;

• periodic monitoring of funding levels and funding ratios;
• periodic monitoring of compliance with asset allocation guidelines;
• periodic monitoring of asset class and/or investment manager
•

performance against benchmarks; and
periodic risk capital analysis and stress testing.

Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan Assets

The assets of the Company’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact
of any individual investment. The U.S. qualified pension plan is diversified
across multiple asset classes, with publicly traded fixed income, hedge funds,
publicly traded equity and real estate representing the most significant asset
allocations. Investments in these four asset classes are further diversified
across funds, managers, strategies, vintages, sectors and geographies,
depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class. The pension
assets for the Company’s non-U.S. Significant Plans are primarily invested in
publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities.

Post Employment Plans

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors U.S. post employment plans that provide income
continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible U.S.
employees on long-term disability.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the plans’ funded status recognized
in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet was $(32) million and $(46)
million, respectively. The pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $(15)
million and $3 million, respectively. The improvement in funded status as of
December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the Company’s funding of the VEBA
Trust during 2017.
The following table summarizes the components of net expense
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the Company’s U.S.
post employment plans:

The Company sponsors defined contribution plans in the U.S. and in certain
non-U.S. locations, all of which are administered in accordance with local
laws. The most significant defined contribution plan is the Citi Retirement
Savings Plan (formerly known as the Citigroup 401(k) Plan) sponsored by
the Company in the U.S.
Under the Citi Retirement Savings Plan, eligible U.S. employees received
matching contributions of up to 6% of their eligible compensation for 2018
and 2017, subject to statutory limits. Additionally, for eligible employees
whose eligible compensation is $100,000 or less, a fixed contribution of up
to 2% of eligible compensation is provided. All Company contributions are
invested according to participants’ individual elections. The following table
summarizes the Company contributions for the defined contribution plans:

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s effective tax rate for 2018 was 22.8%
(23.3% excluding the effect of provisional amounts pursuant to SAB 118).
The rate is lower than the 29.8% reported in 2017 (excluding the one-time
impact of Tax Reform) primarily due to the U.S. statutory rate reduction
from 35% to 21% as part of Tax Reform.

Non-U.S. Earnings
Non-U.S. pretax earnings approximated $16.1 billion in 2018 (of which a
$21 million loss was recorded in Discontinued operations), $13.7 billion
in 2017 and $11.6 billion in 2016. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and
its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S.
pretax earnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a separate
foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also, dividends from a non-U.S.
subsidiary or affiliate are effectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company
provides income taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S.
subsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are indefinitely
reinvested outside the U.S.
At December 31, 2018, $15.5 billion of basis differences of non-U.S.
subsidiaries was indefinitely invested. At the existing tax rates, additional
taxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $4.3 billion would have to be provided if such basis
differences were realized.
Income taxes are not provided for the Company’s “savings bank base
year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988, because under current
U.S. tax rules, such taxes will become payable only to the extent that
such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal
law. At December 31, 2018, the amount of the base year reserves totaled
approximately $358 million (subject to a tax of $75 million).

As of December 31, 2018, Citi was under audit by the Internal Revenue
Service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world. It is thus
reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of
unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, although
Citi does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a
significant change to its effective tax rate.
The following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company and
its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination:

Deferred Tax Assets
As of December 31, 2018, Citi had a valuation allowance of $9.3 billion,
composed of valuation allowances of $6.0 billion on its FTC carry-forwards,
$1.7 billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its non-U.S. branches,
$1.5 billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $0.1 billion on state net operating
loss carry-forwards. The valuation allowance against FTCs results from the
impact of the lower tax rate and the new separate FTC basket for non-U.S.
branches, as well as the diminished ability under Tax Reform to generate
income from sources outside the U.S. to support FTC utilization. The absolute
amount of Citi’s post-Tax Reform-related valuation allowances may change
in future years. First, the separate FTC basket for non-U.S. branches will
result in additional DTAs (for FTCs) requiring a valuation allowance, given
that the local tax rate for these branches exceeds on average the U.S. tax rate
of 21%. Second, in Citi’s general basket for FTCs, changes in the forecasted
amount of income in U.S. locations derived from sources outside the U.S.
could alter the amount of valuation allowance that is needed against such
FTCs. The following table summarizes Citi’s DTAs:

The time remaining for utilization of the FTC component has shortened,
given the passage of time. Although realization is not assured, Citi
believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of $22.9 billion at
December 31, 2018 is more-likely-than-not, based upon expectations as
to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and
consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740,
Income Taxes).
Citi believes the U.S. federal and New York State and City NOL carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the DTAs
pertaining to the existing NOL carry-forwards. This is due to Citi’s forecast
of sufficient U.S. taxable income and the fact that New York State and City
continue to tax Citi’s non-U.S. income.
With respect to the FTCs component of the DTAs, the carry-forward
period is 10 years. Utilization of FTCs in any year is restricted to 21% of
foreign source taxable income in that year. However, overall domestic losses
that Citi has incurred of approximately $47 billion as of December 31,
2018 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent
of 50%–100% of domestic source income produced in subsequent years.
Such resulting foreign source income would cover the FTC carry-forwards
after valuation allowance. As noted in the tables above, Citi’s FTC carryforwards were $6.8 billion ($12.8 billion before valuation allowance) as of
December 31, 2018, compared to $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. Citi
believes that it will generate sufficient U.S. taxable income within the 10-year
carry-forward period to be able to utilize the net FTCs after the valuation
allowance, after considering any FTCs produced in the tax return for such
period, which must be used prior to any carry-forward utilization.

Collateral typically consists of government and government-agency
securities, corporate and municipal bonds, equities and mortgage- and other
asset-backed securities.
The resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented
under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of all
transactions (including the liquidation of securities held) and the offsetting
of obligations to return cash or securities by the non-defaulting party,
following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant
master agreement. Events of default generally include (i) failure to deliver
cash or securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to provide
or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach
of representation, (iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into
among the parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation
of obligations under the agreement. The counterparty that receives the
securities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in its use of the
securities, with the exception of transactions executed on a tri-party basis,
where the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations
may restrict its use of the securities.
A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is
recorded at fair value, as described in Notes 24 and 25 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of
cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the
respective agreements.
The securities borrowing and lending agreements also represent
collateralized financing transactions similar to the resale and repurchase
agreements. Collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.
Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing
and lending agreements are generally documented under industry standard
agreements that allow the prompt close-out of all transactions (including
the liquidation of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return
cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment default
or other default by the other party under the relevant master agreement.
Events of default and rights to use securities under the securities borrowing
and lending agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements
referenced above.
A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is
recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion
is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for
certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities loaned,
the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess
of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the
market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis
and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual
margin protection.

(1) The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending transactions of $15.9 billion and
$14.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and
receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these transactions, the Company
recognizes the securities received at fair value within Other assets and the obligation to return those
securities as a liability within Brokerage payables.

The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing
transactions. Citi executes these transactions primarily through its brokerdealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matched-book activity and to
efficiently fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions executed by
Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity.
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions,
including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking
into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating
financing tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing
transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in
capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. Additionally, Citi
maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers
and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.
It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral,
monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements
and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in
order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase
agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in
order to maintain contractual margin protection.

171

The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting
agreements for resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing
and lending agreements, is evidenced to the extent that a supportive legal
opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that
provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of
these agreements. Also, the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to
terminate and close out transactions on a net basis under these agreements
will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default
including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.
A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain
jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine
the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting
regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency law for a

particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or unclear as overlapping
regimes may exist. For example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,
municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans.

agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and the related
offsetting amount permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include

12. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE
PAYABLES

The Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments sold
to and purchased from brokers, dealers and customers, which arise in the
ordinary course of business. Citi is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of
brokers, dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial
instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or purchase the
financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the
extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to
the transaction and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question.
Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities
by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with
regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and
customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot
meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate sufficient underlying
financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the
required margin level.
Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may
impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to Citi. Credit limits
are established and closely monitored for customers and for brokers and
dealers engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be
credit sensitive.
Brokerage receivables and Brokerage payables consisted of the following:

Overview

Citi adopted ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-03 as of January 1, 2018. The ASUs
require fair value changes on marketable equity securities to be recognized
in earnings. The available-for-sale category was eliminated for equity
securities. Also, non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the

measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal
Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats
that continue to be carried at cost. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional details.

The Company has sold certain debt securities that were classified as
HTM. These sales were in response to significant deterioration in the
creditworthiness of the issuers or securities or because the Company has
collected a substantial portion (at least 85%) of the principal outstanding
at acquisition of the security. In addition, certain other debt securities were
reclassified to AFS investments in response to significant credit deterioration.

Because the Company generally intends to sell these reclassified debt
securities, Citi recorded OTTI on the securities. The following table presents,
for the periods indicated, the carrying value of HTM debt securities sold
and reclassified to AFS, as well as the related gain (loss) or the OTTI losses
recorded on these securities:

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These securitization entities are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of
the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) In the second quarter of 2017, Citi early adopted ASU 2017-08, Receivable—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. Upon adoption,
a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to reduce Retained earnings, effective January 1, 2017, for the incremental amortization of purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments on callable
state and municipal debt securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Citi adopted ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-03 as of January 1, 2018, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment from AOCI to Retained earnings for net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities AFS. The AFS
category was eliminated for equity securities effective January 1, 2018. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

At December 31, 2018, the amortized cost of fixed income securities
exceeded their fair value by $3,220 million. Of the $3,220 million,
$752 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments
that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for less than a year
and, of these, 92% were rated investment grade; and $2,468 million

represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been
in a gross-unrealized-loss position for a year or more and, of these, 98%
were rated investment grade. Of the $2,468 million mentioned above,
$1,297 million represents U.S. Treasury securities.

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These securitization entities are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of
the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) In November 2018, Citibank transferred $10 billion of agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) from AFS classification to HTM classification in
accordance with ASC 320. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized loss position of $598 million. This amount will remain in AOCI and be amortized over the remaining life of the securities.
(3) In the second quarter of 2017, Citi early adopted ASU 2017-08. Upon adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to reduce Retained earnings, effective January 1, 2017, for the incremental amortization of
purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments that would have been recorded under the ASU on callable state and municipal debt securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

179

The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to
maturity or, where applicable, to exercise any issuer call options, absent any
unforeseen significant changes in circumstances, including deterioration in
credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements.
The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM securities primarily
relate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were transferred to
HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. The net

unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-related changes in fair
value of HTM debt securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded
in earnings. The AOCI balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized
as an adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion of any
difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the
same debt securities.

Note: E xcluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table are $(653) million and $(117) million of net unrealized losses recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily
related to the difference between the amortized cost and carrying value of HTM debt securities that were reclassified from AFS. Substantially all of these net unrecognized losses relate to securities that have been in a
loss position for 12 months or longer at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Debt Securities
The difference between amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized
in earnings as OTTI for impaired debt securities that the Company has an
intent to sell, or for which the Company believes it will more-likely-than-not
be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for
those securities that the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely
to be required to sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in
earnings and any non-credit-related impairment is recorded in AOCI.
For debt securities, credit impairment exists where management does not
expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to
recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security.

Evaluating Investments for Other-ThanTemporary Impairment

Overview
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized
losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. These
reviews apply to all securities that are not measured at fair value through
earnings. Effective January 1, 2018, the AFS category was eliminated for
equity securities and, therefore, other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI)
review is not required for those securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details.
An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual
security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are
determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI for
AFS securities. Temporary losses related to HTM debt securities generally are
not recorded, as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost
basis. However, for HTM debt securities with credit-related impairment, the
credit loss is recognized in earnings as OTTI, and any difference between
the cost basis adjusted for the OTTI and fair value is recognized in AOCI and
amortized as an adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of
the security. For debt securities transferred to HTM from Trading account
assets, amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date
of transfer, plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized in
earnings subsequent to transfer. For debt securities transferred to HTM from
AFS, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost, adjusted for the
cumulative accretion or amortization of any purchase discount or premium,
plus or minus any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments, net of accretion
or amortization, and less any impairment recognized in earnings.
Regardless of the classification of securities as AFS or HTM, the Company
assesses each position with an unrealized loss for OTTI. Factors considered in
determining whether a loss is temporary include:

AFS Equity Securities and Equity Method Investments
For AFS equity securities, prior to January 1, 2018, management considered
the various factors described above, including its intent and ability to hold an
equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to cost, or whether it
was more-likely-than-not that the Company would have been required to sell
the security prior to recovery of its cost basis. Where management lacked that
intent or ability, the security’s decline in fair value was deemed to be otherthan-temporary and was recorded in earnings. Effective January 1, 2018, the
AFS category has been eliminated for equity securities and, therefore, OTTI
review is not required for those securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details.
Management also assesses equity method investments that have fair
values that are less than their respective carrying values for OTTI. Fair value
is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed
securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see
Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell prior to
recovery of value or would likely be required to sell, with no expectation that
the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment
is recognized in earnings as OTTI regardless of severity and duration. The
measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected recoveries
subsequent to the balance sheet date.
For impaired equity method investments that management does not plan
to sell and is not likely to be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the
evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on
(i) whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and
(ii) whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment
for a period of time sufficient to recover the value. The determination of
whether the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the
following indicators:

• the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost;
• the severity of the impairment;
• the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term
•
•

prospects of the issuer;
activity in the market of the issuer that may indicate adverse credit
conditions; and
the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.

The Company’s review for impairment generally entails:

• identification and evaluation of impaired investments;
• analysis of individual investments that have fair values less than

•

•

• the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term

amortized cost, including consideration of the length of time the
investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the expected
recovery period;
consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors
or triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as having
other-than-temporary impairment and those that would not support
other-than-temporary impairment; and
documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under
business policies.

•
•

prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may influence
the operations of the issuer;
the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and
the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the
carrying value.

The sections below describe the Company’s process for identifying
credit-related impairments for security types that have the most significant
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2018.

182

Cash flow projections are developed using different stress test scenarios.
Management evaluates the results of those stress tests (including the
severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress
scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics
and performance) to assess whether management expects to recover the
amortized cost basis of the security. If cash flow projections indicate that the
Company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis, the Company
recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings.

Mortgage-Backed Securities
For U.S. mortgage-backed securities, credit impairment is assessed using
a cash flow model that estimates the principal and interest cash flows
on the underlying mortgages using the security-specific collateral and
transaction structure. The model distributes the estimated cash flows to the
various tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure and any
subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure. The cash
flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgage-backed securities
through the current period and then estimates the remaining cash flows
using a number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment rates,
recovery rates (on foreclosed properties) and loss severity rates (on nonagency mortgage-backed securities).
Management develops specific assumptions using market data, internal
estimates and estimates published by rating agencies and other third-party
sources. Default rates are projected by considering current underlying
mortgage loan performance, generally assuming the default of (i) 10%
of current loans, (ii) 25% of 30–59 day delinquent loans, (iii) 70% of
60–90 day delinquent loans and (iv) 100% of 91+ day delinquent loans.
These estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve to estimate the
total lifetime pool default rate. Other assumptions contemplate the actual
collateral attributes, including geographic concentrations, rating actions and
current market prices.

State and Municipal Securities
The process for identifying credit impairments in Citigroup’s AFS and HTM
state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that
incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citigroup monitors the bond issuers
and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial
guarantee insurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any
insurance, is Aa3/AA-. In the event of an external rating downgrade or
other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-specific
estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default), the subject bond is
specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected
contractual principal and interest payments.
For state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that Citigroup plans
to sell, or would be more-likely-than-not required to sell, the full impairment
is recognized in earnings.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, the
investment is written down to fair value, with the full difference between the
fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings.
Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured
using the measurement alternative at December 31, 2018, and amounts
recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018:

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at
Fair Value

Effective January 1, 2018, non-marketable equity securities are required to
be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings
unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment
represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or
certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the
measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus
or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions
for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying
value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed
transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to
a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in
rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical
investment held by Citi.
Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed
for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses
whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired.
Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not limited to,
the following:

purposes of the Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment
activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds.
On April 21, 2017, Citi’s request for extension of the permitted holding period
under the Volcker Rule for certain of its investments in illiquid funds was
approved, allowing the Company to hold such investments until the earlier of
five years from the July 21, 2017 expiration date of the general conformance
period, or the date such investments mature or are otherwise conformed with
the Volcker Rule.

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That
Calculate Net Asset Value

The Company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that
calculate net asset value (NAV), or its equivalent, including hedge funds,
private equity funds, funds of funds and real estate funds, as provided by
third-party asset managers. Investments in such funds are generally classified
as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair values of
these investments are estimated using the NAV of the Company’s ownership
interest in the funds. Some of these investments are in “covered funds” for

Delinquency Status
Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit
quality of consumer loans. Principally, the U.S. residential first mortgage
loans use the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method of reporting
delinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has
not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s
next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that
considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by
the close of business on the loan’s next due date.
As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home equity loans and
installment loans are classified as non-accrual when loan payments are
90 days contractually past due. Credit cards and unsecured revolving loans
generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days past due. Home
equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the
related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Mortgage
loans, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured loans, are
classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower
has filed for bankruptcy. Commercial banking loans are placed on a cash
(non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and
a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the
payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is
90 days past due.
The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current status
varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to qualify for these
modifications is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging
from one to three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer
loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans
subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged
to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly
payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under
FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is
subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years).
Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified
under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always
required in order to re-age a modified loan to current.

14. LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: consumer and corporate.
These categories are classified primarily according to the segment and
subsegment that manage the loans.

Citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor, evaluate
and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio.
Credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency
status, consumer credit scores (FICO) and loan to value (LTV) ratios, each as
discussed in more detail below.
Included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may
give rise to greater credit issues. Credit cards with below-market introductory
interest rates and interest-only loans are examples of such products. These
products are closely managed using credit techniques that are intended to
mitigate their higher inherent risk.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company
sold and/or reclassified to HFS $3.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of
consumer loans.

Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities.
Consists of residential first mortgages that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities that are 30–89 days past due of $0.2 billion and 90 days or more past due of $1.0 billion.
Includes approximately $0.1 billion of residential first mortgage loans in process of foreclosure.

Represents loans classified as consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are not included in the Corporate/Other consumer credit metrics.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s risk for
assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history and assign every
consumer a “FICO” (Fair Isaac Corporation) credit score. These scores
are continually updated by the agencies based upon an individual’s credit
actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late payments).
The following tables provide details on the FICO scores for Citi’s
U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables
(commercial banking loans are excluded from the tables since the customers
are businesses and FICO scores are not a primary driver in their credit
evaluation). FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the
portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

A loan is considered impaired when Citi believes it is probable that all
amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan will
not be collected. Impaired consumer loans include non-accrual commercial
banking loans, as well as smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms
have been modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and where Citi
has granted a concession to the borrower. These modifications may include
interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness. Impaired consumer
loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous loans that have not been
modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis.

(1) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government entities, loans subject to long-term standby
commitments (LTSC) with U.S. government-sponsored entities and loans recorded at fair value.
(2) Excludes balances where FICO was not available. Such amounts are not material.

Loan to Value (LTV) Ratios
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are calculated at
origination and updated by applying market price data.
The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for Citi’s
U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the
most recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for substantially all
of the portfolio applied at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, if available,
or the state level if not. The remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar
manner using the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.
(4) Represents portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending upon borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(5) Represents portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(6) Commercial banking loans are generally borrower-specific modifications and incorporate changes in the amount and/or timing of principal and/or interest.
(7) Post-modification balances in North America include $53 million of residential first mortgages and $21 million of home equity loans to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the year ended
December 31, 2017. These amounts include $36 million of residential first mortgages and $18 million of home equity loans that were newly classified as TDRs during 2017, based on previously received OCC
guidance.

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $1.0 billion of
corporate loans during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. The Company did not have significant purchases of corporate
loans classified as held-for-investment for the years ended December 31, 2018
or 2017.
Delinquency Status
Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency
basis. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash
(non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and
a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that
the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal
is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the
process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans
and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings,
and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually
received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability
of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded
investment in the loan. While corporate loans are generally managed based
on their internally assigned risk rating (see further discussion below), the
following tables present delinquency information by corporate loan type.

(1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.
(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are ≥ 90 days past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full,
that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns.

Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and
manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio. As
part of its risk management process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its
corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments
of the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually
or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant.
Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition
of the obligor, qualitative assessment of management and strategy, amount
and sources of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee
arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated with the
obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography.
The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities. The
facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms, which are the product
of the probability of default and the loss given default. The investment grade
rating categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as defined
by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to the bank regulatory
definitions as special mention, substandard and doubtful will have risk
ratings within the non-investment grade categories.

Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is
expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and
there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written
down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value, less cost to sell.
Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual
principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and
there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months,
in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.

(1) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate
loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectable may be
recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.
(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the payment default occurred within
one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is
defined as 90 days past due.

LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids submitted by the banks. Citigroup
pays commitment fees for its lines of credit.
Some of Citigroup’s non-bank subsidiaries have credit facilities with
Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank. Borrowings
under these facilities are secured in accordance with Section 23A of the
Federal Reserve Act.
Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) has borrowing
agreements consisting of facilities that CGMHI has been advised are
available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists. These
arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in
meeting CGMHI’s short-term requirements.

The Company issues both fixed- and variable-rate debt in a range of
currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to
effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The
maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity
structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other
derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt
issuances. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s overall weighted average
interest rate for long-term debt, excluding structured notes accounted for at
fair value, was 3.87% on a contractual basis and 3.84% including the effects
of derivative contracts.

capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets,
Total Leverage Exposure, risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios:

18. REGULATORY CAPITAL

Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital and leverage standards issued
by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules.

Banking Subsidiaries—Constraints on Dividends

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup and Citibank were “well
capitalized” under the current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as
of December 31, 2018.

There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary
depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends, or otherwise supply
funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends
declared in any calendar year were to exceed amounts specified by the
agency’s regulations.
In determining the dividends, each subsidiary depository institution
must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage
ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal bank
regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should
generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Citigroup received
$8.3 billion and $7.5 billion in dividends from Citibank during 2018 and
2017, respectively.

During 2018, Citi distributed $1,173 million in dividends on its
outstanding preferred stock. Based on its preferred stock outstanding as of
December 31, 2018, Citi estimates it will distribute preferred dividends of
approximately $1,109 million during 2019, assuming such dividends are
declared by the Citi Board of Directors.

The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest
in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the
VIE. Citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and
be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics:

21. SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST
ENTITIES
Uses of Special Purpose Entities

A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a specific
limited need of the company that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs
by Citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing
certain financial assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets
and to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized in
various legal forms, including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a
securitization, through the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments,
certificates, commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company
transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of those assets into
cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business.
These issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may
or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that
organized the SPE.
Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the SPE, but may
also benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account,
a line of credit or a liquidity facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset
purchase agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances
typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could
obtain for its own debt issuances. This results in less expensive financing
costs than unsecured debt. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts
in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match
the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE.
Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the
counterparty to any related derivative contracts.
Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities (VIEs), as
described below.

• power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
entity’s economic performance; and

• an obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be

significant to the VIE, or a right to receive benefits from the entity that
could potentially be significant to the VIE.

The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the purpose and
design of the entity, the role the Company had in the entity’s design and its
involvement in the VIE’s ongoing activities. The Company then must evaluate
which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the
VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.
For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, the Company must then evaluate its economic interests, if any,
and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could
potentially be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the Company
has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant, it
considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of
probability. Such obligations could be in various forms, including, but not
limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity agreements and
certain derivative contracts.
In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as a derivative
counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap or
purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE),
(ii) act as underwriter or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative,
trustee or other services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other
instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers such
involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator
of power or potentially significant benefits or losses.

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient
to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions
through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive the expected
residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of
the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests or
other counterparties providing other forms of support, such as guarantees,
certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable
interest holders in the entity.

The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows this table.
Included on Citigroup’s December 31, 2018 and 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company has any variable interest or continuing involvement considered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of loss.
Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and non-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These SPEs are not consolidated. See “Re-securitizations” below for further discussion.

212

—

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts
of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may
represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending
on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the Company’s
standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business.
The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has
significant involvement represent the most current information available to
the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost
basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily
available to the Company.
The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying
amount of the Company’s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial
amount of cash invested in the VIE adjusted for any accrued interest and
cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be
adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions
represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity
and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of
a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other
arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g.,
interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the
purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE).
Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum
exposure amounts.

The previous tables do not include the following:

• certain venture capital investments made by some of the Company’s

•
•
•

•

•
•

private equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments
in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in ASC
Topic 946);
certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment
management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company
provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company
holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on
arm’s-length terms;
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by
the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or
Investments, in which the Company has no other involvement with
the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (for more
information on these positions, see Notes 13 and 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements);
certain representations and warranties exposures in legacy ICG-sponsored
mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations, in which the Company
has no variable interest or continuing involvement as servicer. The
outstanding balance of mortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in
which the Company has no variable interest or continuing involvement as
servicer was approximately $7 billion and $9 billion at December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively;
certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential
mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances
are no longer outstanding; and
VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection with the
Company’s funding activities. The Company does not have a variable
interest in these trusts.

Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, which are
securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets
remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received
are recognized as secured liabilities. The consolidated VIEs represent more
than a hundred separate entities with which the Company is involved. In
general, the third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs
have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have
such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee
to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions

involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss
related to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value
of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing.
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as
collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay
down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general
assets. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about these
Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

Credit Card Securitizations
The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to
purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a
non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations;
as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to
purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust.
Substantially all of the Company’s credit card securitization activity is
through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and
Citibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority
through the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities because,

as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. Citigroup
holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts, which
could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the
trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables remain on Citi’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss recognized. The debt issued
by the trusts to third parties is included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business
in North America. The following table reflects amounts related to the
Company’s securitized credit card receivables:

average maturity of the term notes issued by the Master Trust was 3.0 years as
of December 31, 2018 and 2.6 years as of December 31, 2017.

Managed Loans
After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to
maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing
for receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers
the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages.
As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all managed securitized card
receivables are on-balance sheet.

Mortgage Securitizations
Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse
customer base. Once originated, the Company often securitizes these loans
through the use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of trust
certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have
the same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of
liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces
Citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations
are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future
credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust.
Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing
rights and in certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only
strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also
provides servicing for a limited number of ICG securitizations. Citi’s ICG
business may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention
rules or in connection with secondary market-making activities.
The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a
government-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label (non-agencysponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary

of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because
Citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. Therefore, Citi
does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization
entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through
non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage
loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, except for
MSRs, which are included in Mortgage servicing rights on Citigroup’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage
securitization entities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power
to direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the
servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi
is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.
In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to direct the activities
and (ii) the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
that could be potentially significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage
securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus,
consolidates the VIE.

Note: Excludes re-securitization transactions.
(1) The proceeds from new securitizations in 2016 include $0.3 billion related to personal loan securitizations.

For non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the transfer
of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale accounting, Citi recognizes
a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the
transferred assets and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be
beneficial interests or servicing rights).

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31,
2018 were $17 million and $36 million, respectively.
Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year ended December 31,
2017 were $28 million and $70 million, respectively, and $76 million and

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s U.S. consumer
mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights, which entitle
the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding
principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to
service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a
termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees.
These transactions create intangible assets referred to as MSRs, which are
recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of
Citi’s capitalized MSRs was $584 million and $558 million at December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances
of $62 billion and $66 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits
The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit
business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits
and also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper
conduits sponsored by third parties.
Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide
the Company’s clients access to low-cost funding in the commercial paper
markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to
clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors.
The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by Citi. The funding
of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements
provided by the Company.
As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is generally responsible
for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits,
making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including
determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued,
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and
facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the
Company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions
and earns an administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the
income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after
payment of conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients.
Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and fees are
relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size.
The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest in liquid
securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets are privately
negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be
held by the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield earned
by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial
paper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each
asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit
enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, including
over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct
recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized
with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on
Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the conduits
had approximately $18.8 billion and $19.3 billion of purchased assets
outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding commitments with
clients of approximately $14.0 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively.
Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted
average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were
approximately 53 and 51 days, respectively.

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in
prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates.
Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments,
which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk,
Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs
through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and
sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities all
classified as Trading account assets. The Company receives fees during the
course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these
fees were as follows:

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt
securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests.
Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization
entities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These securities
are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often
structured on behalf of clients.
As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in private
label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately
$16 million (all related to re-securitization transactions executed prior to
2016), which has been recorded in Trading account assets. Of this amount,
all was related to subordinated beneficial interests. As of December 31, 2017,
the fair value of Citi-retained interests in private label re-securitization
transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $79 million (all related
to re-securitization transactions executed prior to 2016). Of this amount,
substantially all was related to subordinated beneficial interests. The original
par value of private label re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds
a retained interest as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately
$271 million and $887 million, respectively.
The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair
value of approximately $26.3 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively, to
re-securitization entities.
As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency
re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately
$2.5 billion (including $1.4 billion related to re-securitization transactions
executed in 2018) compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017
(including $854 million related to re-securitization transactions executed
in 2017), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The original fair
value of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained
interest as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $70.9 billion
and $68.3 billion, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not consolidate any
private label or agency re-securitization entities.

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)
A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases a portfolio
of assets consisting primarily of non-investment grade corporate loans.
CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the
asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the
CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase
the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk
associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the asset manager directs
purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the CLO’s asset
management agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager
will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly
impact the economic performance of the CLO. Investors in a CLO, through
their ownership of debt and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of
the CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances,
optionally redeeming the notes, voting on amendments to the CLO’s
operating documents and other activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically
12 years.
Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the CLOs.
Typically, the debt and equity of the CLOs are sold to third-party investors.
On occasion, certain Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s
liabilities for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, typically
in the secondary market, certain securities issued by the CLOs to support its
market making activities.
The Company does not generally have the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLOs, as this
power is generally held by a third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such,
those CLOs are not consolidated.
The following tables summarize selected cash flow information and
retained interests related to Citigroup CLOs:

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is
in the form of transaction-specific credit enhancements described above.
In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancements, the conduits,
other than the government guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained a
letter of credit from the Company, which is equal to at least 8% to 10% of
the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $200 million. The letters of credit
provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $1.7 billion as
of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The net result across multi-seller conduits
administered by the Company is that, in the event defaulted assets exceed
the transaction-specific credit enhancements described above, any losses in
each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial
paper investors.
Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity
agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event
of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduits is
supported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has generally
agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at
par. The APA is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit, as it
generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any
funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to
increased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the conduits with
program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term lending commitments.
Under these commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper market,
subject to specified conditions. The Company receives fees for providing
both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair
market terms.
Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper
issued by the conduits and earns a market-based fee for providing such
services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company makes a market
in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial
paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity
in the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper
issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as conduits
administered by third parties. Separately, in the normal course of business,
Citi purchases commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by
Citigroup's conduits. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company owned
$5.5 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by
its administered conduits. The Company's investments were not driven by
market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to
purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.
The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are consolidated by Citi.
The Company has determined that, through its roles as administrator
and liquidity provider, it has the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. These powers
include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the
conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities, its ability
to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management.
In addition, as a result of all the Company’s involvement described above, it
was concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could potentially be
significant. However, the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and
apart from those of Citigroup. No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy
the creditors of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
Municipal TOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities.
TOB trusts are typically structured as single-issuer entities whose assets are
purchased from either the Company or from other investors in the municipal
securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets
by issuing two classes of certificates: long-dated, floating rate certificates
(“Floaters”) that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual
interest certificates (“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The Residuals
are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are
being financed.
From Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of TOB trusts: customer
and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts are those trusts utilized by
customers of the Company to finance their securities, generally municipal
securities. The Residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer
being financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are generally used by the Company
to finance its own municipal securities investments; the Residuals issued by
non-customer TOB trusts are purchased by the Company.
With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB trusts, Citi may
provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters are optionally tendered and
the Company, in its role as remarketing agent, is unable to find a new
investor to purchase the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified
period of time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the tendered
Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the Company’s inventory of such
Floaters fluctuates.
For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a voluntary
advance provider. In this capacity, the Company may, but is not obligated
to, make loan advances to customer TOB trusts to purchase optionally
tendered Floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to
new investors. Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of December 31,
2018, Citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer TOB trusts.
For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also provides credit
enhancement. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, none of the municipal
bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee
provided by the Company.
Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts. If a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a
credit event on the underlying municipal bonds, the underlying municipal
bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem
the outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall between the
bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered Floaters, the
Company, pursuant to the liquidity agreement, would be obligated to make
a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB
trusts, Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the
holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual holder is obligated
to reimburse the Company for any payment the Company makes under the
liquidity arrangement. These reimbursement agreements may be subject to
daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying

All of Citi’s retained interests were held-to-maturity securities as of
December 31, 2018 and substantially all were held-to-maturity securities as
of December 31, 2017.
Asset-Based Financing
The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs that hold
assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans
originated or purchased by the Company. Financings in the form of debt
securities or derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading
account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings. The
Company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance; thus, it does not
consolidate them.
The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the
unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s maximum
exposure to loss are shown below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the
VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held
by the VIE.

Client Intermediation
Client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions
designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns
of an underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions
include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions,
the VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced
asset or index through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap
or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE issues notes to investors that pay a
return based on the specified underlying security, referenced asset or index.
The VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance
contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of
the transaction. The Company’s involvement in these transactions includes
being the counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing in a
portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain transactions, the investor’s
maximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above
a specified level. Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the
VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it
does not consolidate them.
Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount
invested in notes issued by the VIE and the notional amount of any risk of
loss absorbed by Citi through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The
derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a receivable from
the VIE (for example, where the Company purchases credit protection from
the VIE in connection with the VIE’s issuance of a credit-linked note), which
is collateralized by the assets owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments
are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not
included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the VIE.

municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed,
whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as
Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider.
For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as tender option
provider. The tender option provider arrangement allows Floater holders
to put their interests directly to the Company at any time, subject to the
requisite notice period requirements, at a price of par.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, liquidity agreements provided with
respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $4.3 billion and $3.2 billion,
respectively, of which $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, were offset
by reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB
transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25%
of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement
agreement was executed.
Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB trusts to be VIEs.
Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated by the Company, as the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic
performance rests with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.
Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated because the
Company holds the Residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.
The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of
credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not
variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled
$6.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. These liquidity agreements
and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various
term-out provisions.

Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and
retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity,
hedge funds, real estate, fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns
a management fee, which is a percentage of capital under management,
and may earn performance fees. In addition, for some of these funds the
Company has an ownership interest in the investment funds. Citi has also
established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified
employees to invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as
investment manager for these funds and may provide employees with
financing on both recourse and non-recourse bases for a portion of the
employees’ investment commitments.

Municipal Investments
Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in
partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income
housing, facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the
construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a
return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from
the investments made by the partnership. The Company may also provide
construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation
of real estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are generally
considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities of these entities is typically
held by the general partner. Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated
by Citigroup.

222

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in
excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market
risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations
in interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other factors
and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the
tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility. Credit risk
is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by Citi is
not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized
gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the
probability of counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure
that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to
monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost
in periods of high volatility and financial stress.
Derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry
standard master netting agreements, which provide that following an event
of default, the non-defaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions
between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by,
the defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a payment
on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable
notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of agreement that remains uncured
after applicable notice and grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation,
(iv) cross default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative transactions
entered into between the parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates, (v) the
occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in a party’s becoming
a materially weaker credit and (vi) the cessation or repudiation of any
applicable guarantee or other credit support document. Obligations under
master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an
industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement. An
event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails
to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable
notice and grace periods.
The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting
agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal
opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides
(i) the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability, and (ii) that the
exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close-out
transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or
avoided under applicable law upon an event of default, including bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceeding.

22. DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of
derivative transactions, which include:

• Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments to buy or

•

•

sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a
contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item
readily convertible to cash.
Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date
or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years, based on
differentials between specified indices or financial instruments, as applied
to a notional principal amount.
Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a premium, the right,
but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a specified time a financial
instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be
settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices.

Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with
those counterparties, except for swap contracts that are novated and “cleared”
through central counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option
contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with
a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction. Citigroup
enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate, foreign currency,
commodity and other market/credit risks for the following reasons:

• Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an active market

•

maker. Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their
risk management actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate,
foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their own trading
purposes. Citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through
offsetting trade activities, controls focused on price verification and daily
reporting of positions to senior managers.
Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its own risk
management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile
of the Company. Hedging may be accomplished by applying hedge
accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or
by an economic hedge. For example, Citigroup issues fixed-rate longterm debt and then enters into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest
rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically
convert the interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy
is the most common form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net
interest cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also
used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance
sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities, commodities and
borrowings, as well as other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In
addition, foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollardenominated debt, foreign currency-denominated AFS securities and net
investment exposures.

223

A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local
law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse
case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability
of such rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the
insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For example,
this may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central banks and
U.S. pension plans.
Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility,
which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations
to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for
customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers the level of
legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master
netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in
its risk management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts much lower
volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where Citi does not
have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability, because
such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit
limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements.

Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 government
debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to
secure the net open exposure of the other party; the receiving party is free
to commingle/rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its
business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds,
U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also be pledged as collateral for
derivative transactions. Security collateral posted to open and maintain a
master netting agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or
securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account at a third-party
custodian pursuant to a tri-party account control agreement.
As of January 1, 2018, Citigroup early adopted ASU 2017-12, Targeted
Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities. This standard primarily
impacts Citi’s accounting for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and
fair value hedges. Refer to the respective sections below for details.

224

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivative activities, based on notional
amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are
reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not
represent a complete and accurate measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative
transactions. Rather, Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market
fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or
periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as
any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions.
Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades.

For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with
$100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite
pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative
notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de
minimis overall market risk. Aggregate derivative notional amounts can
fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on
Citi’s market share, levels of client activity and other factors. All derivatives
are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection buyer) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller
to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,
reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk.

225

The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the
Company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017. Gross positive fair values are offset against
gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master
netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in
respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty
pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount,
if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral
rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for
security collateral.
In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing
organizations that require or allow entities to treat derivative assets, liabilities
and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair
value for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross

derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the
counterparties would record a related collateral payable or receivable. As a
result, the tables reflect a reduction of approximately $100 billion as of both
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of derivative assets and derivative
liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross basis, but are
now settled and not subject to collateral. The tables also present amounts that
are not permitted to be offset, such as security collateral or cash collateral
posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to
the extent that an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting
enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.

hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. Hedge
effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner
for similar hedges, and are used consistently throughout the hedging
relationships. The assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the
value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and
the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value. Prior
to January 1, 2018, these excluded items were recognized in current earnings
for the hedging derivative, while changes in the value of a hedged item that
were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded. Upon adoption of ASC
2017-12, Citi excludes changes in the cross currency basis associated with
cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records
it in other comprehensive income.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the amounts
recognized in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement
of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging
relationship, as well as the underlying non-derivative instruments, are
presented in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroup
presents this disclosure by showing derivative gains and losses related to its
trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative
instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these
portfolios are risk managed.
The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement
of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging
relationship are shown below. The table below does not include any offsetting
gains (losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that such
amounts are also recorded in Other revenue.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting

A hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge
objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item for the risk being hedged. Management may voluntarily
de-designate an accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedging relationship
is not highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must
be de-designated. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are
recognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions, similar to trading
derivatives, with no offset recorded related to the hedged item.
For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item
remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized
as an element of the yield on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes
in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the earnings
of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.
However, if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted
transactions will not occur, any amounts that remain in AOCI related to these
transactions must be immediately reflected in Other revenue.
The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with
the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits
and controls. The underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be
an individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

Accounting for Derivative Hedging

Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, hedge accounting is permitted
where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest rate or
foreign exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or
liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset,
liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings.
Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair
value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the
variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges. Hedges that
utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange
risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign operation) are net
investment hedges.
To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules
(versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied),
a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk
designated as being hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally
documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management
objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes the item and risk(s)
being hedged, the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness
will be assessed. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and
prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation, with

229

Hedging of Commodity Price Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price
movements in physical commodities inventory. The hedging instrument is a
futures contract to sell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change
in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets
the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in
earnings. Although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates, Citigroup excludes
the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the
futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortizes it
directly into earnings over the life of the hedge.

Fair Value Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term
debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or loans.
For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in the
fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk, either total cash flows or benchmark
only cash flows, are presented within Interest revenue or Interest expense
based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. Prior to the
adoption of ASU 2017-12, the fair value of the derivative was presented in
Other revenue or Principal transactions and the difference between the
changes in the hedged item and the derivative was defined as ineffectiveness.
Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements in available-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt
that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of
the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt, which may be within
or outside the U.S. The hedging instrument may be a forward foreign
exchange contract or a cross-currency swap contract. Citigroup considers
the premium associated with forward contracts (i.e., the differential between
the spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of hedging; this amount
is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly
in earnings over the life of the hedge. Beginning January 1, 2018, Citi
excludes changes in cross-currency basis associated with cross-currency
swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other
comprehensive income.

January 1, 2018 are included in Other revenue or Principal transactions on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges both prior to and after January 1, 2018 is recorded
in Net interest revenue and is excluded from this table.
(2) Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings on designated and qualifying fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(31) million for interest rate hedges and $49 million for foreign exchange
hedges, for a total of $18 million. Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings on designated and qualifying fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(84) million for interest rate hedges and
$4 million for foreign exchange hedges, for a total of $(80) million.
(3) Amounts relate to the premium associated with forward contracts (differential between spot and contractual forward rates). These amounts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are reflected
directly in earnings. After January 1, 2018, amounts include cross-currency basis, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of cross-currency basis that was included in AOCI was
$(74) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, none of which was recognized in earnings.

Cumulative Basis Adjustment

Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying
value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of
changes in the hedged risk. The hedge basis adjustment, whether arising
from an active or de-designated hedge relationship, remains with the hedged
item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table
below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s hedged assets and liabilities
under qualifying fair value hedges at December 31, 2018, along with the
cumulative hedge basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those
hedged assets and liabilities.

With the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Citigroup hedges the variability from
changes in a contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change in
fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in AOCI. Prior to the adoption
of ASU 2017-12, to the extent that these derivatives were not fully effective,
changes in their fair values in excess of changes in the value of the hedged
transactions were immediately included in Other revenue. With the adoption
of ASU 2017-12, such amounts are no longer required to be immediately
recognized in income, but instead the full change in the value of the hedging
instrument is required to be recognized in AOCI, and then recognized in
earnings in the same period that the cash flows impact earnings. The pretax
change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:

Cash Flow Hedges

Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with
floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. Variable cash
flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows
by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate swaps. Variable cash flows
associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash
flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These
cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset
ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective
at inception and on an ongoing basis. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12,
Citigroup designated the risk being hedged as the risk of overall variability in
the hedged cash flows for certain items.

(1) After January 1, 2018, all amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net interest revenue). For all other hedges, including interest rate hedges prior to
January 1, 2018, the amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

For cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the hedging
derivative remain in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be
included in the earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the
hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings. The net gain (loss)
associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI
within 12 months of December 31, 2018 is approximately $404 million. The
maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is
10 years.
The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note 19 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Investment Hedges
Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—Foreign
Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency
risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign
currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk
associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollarfunctional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup records the change in the
carrying amount of these investments in the Foreign currency translation
adjustment account within AOCI. Simultaneously, the effective portion
of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the Foreign currency
translation adjustment account and any ineffective portion is immediately
recorded in earnings.
For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the
forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35. According to that method,
all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate
component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of
foreign currency options, are recorded in the Foreign currency translation
adjustment account within AOCI.
For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that are designated
as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded
in the Foreign currency translation adjustment account is based on
the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective
subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup.
To the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly
matches the hedged net investment, and the underlying exchange rate of
the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between
the functional currency of the net investment and Citigroup’s functional
currency (or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument, such
instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment),
no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings.
The pretax gain (loss) recorded in the Foreign currency translation
adjustment account within AOCI, related to net investment hedges, is
$1,207 million, $2,528 million and $(220) million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value
under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made upon
issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in
earnings. The changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also
reflected in earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value
change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in
the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the
difference is automatically captured in current earnings.
Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component
of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates
its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting
hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits.
Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked
to market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to
originate one- to four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs.
Credit Derivatives
Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through these
contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name
or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help
mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other
cash positions and to facilitate client transactions.
Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts.
As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 98% of the gross
receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains collateral
agreements. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable balance
owed to Citi) are banks, financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts
with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events.
However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by
lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral.
The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps,
total return swaps, credit options and credit-linked notes.
A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller
agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a
predefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit events are defined
by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness
and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of
transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that reference
emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events
to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a
payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided
on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities. If there is no
credit event, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the protection
seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the
contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs as defined in
the specific derivative contract sold, the protection seller will be required to
make a payment to the protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of
protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount
of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be
required to pay for losses up to a specified amount.

Economic Hedges
Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be
too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are
economic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value included in
either Principal transactions or Other revenue.
For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is
recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.
For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or
for which management decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the
derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated
changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be
carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are affected by the
interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value,
but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt.

233

A total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of
a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital
appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate of
interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller
and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with
the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total return
swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment
any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the
reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset.
A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a
credit event with respect to the reference entity, subject to the provisions of
the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the
protection buyer.
A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge
changes in the credit quality of a reference entity. For example, in a credit
spread option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell
credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level.
The option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the
reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread
level. The payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular
credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other
reference entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with
respect to the underlying reference entity.
A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt
security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note
effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a
return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying
reference credit. If the reference entity defaults, the note may be cash settled
or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity. Thus,
the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid
for the credit-linked note.

235

Fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any
netting agreements and cash collateral. For notional amounts, Citi generally
has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased
and sold, and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering
into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The open risk
exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain
cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts
are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level
of subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit derivatives
portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate payment/performance
risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference
asset or entity. Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are
considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below is considered
non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related
external rating system.
Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives
for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned
to the underlying reference credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying
non-investment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to
the Company. The non-investment grade category in the table above also
includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been
downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative.
The maximum potential amount of future payments under credit
derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional
value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the notional amount for
credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based
on historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the value
of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most
credit derivative contracts, should a credit event occur, the Company usually
is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the
reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit protection sold
has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty,
as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures,
including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance
with a related master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes,
determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative
exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies,
including purchased credit derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings
of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured in the
table above.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives

Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company
to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding
liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the
credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the
Company and its affiliates.
The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with creditrisk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at both
December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $33 billion and $29 billion, respectively.
The Company posted $33 billion and $28 billion as collateral for this
exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement
requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that
Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major
rating agencies as of December 31, 2018, the Company could be required
to post an additional $0.6 billion as either collateral or settlement of the
derivative transactions. Additionally, the Company could be required to
segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from
existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $0.1 billion upon
the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and
collateral requirements of approximately $0.7 billion.
Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers

The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic
exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other
financial assets referenced in the contract. In certain cases, the derivative
transaction is accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced
financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in response
to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in whole or in part, its
synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced
asset in funded form. In certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as
sales, resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the related
sale conditions for transfers of financial assets). For a significant portion of
the transactions, the Company has also executed another total return swap
where the Company passes on substantially all of the economic return of
the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure. In
those cases, the Company is not exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the
economic return of the referenced securities.

236

These transactions generally involve the transfer of the Company’s
liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate
equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically
total return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing
margin requirements.
When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the Company reports
the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports
the accompanying derivative transaction. These transactions generally do
not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred
security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading portfolio. For
transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for
which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure
to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same
counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale and still outstanding, both
the asset amounts derecognized and gross cash proceeds received as of the
date of derecognition were $4.1 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively.
At December 31, 2018, the fair value of these previously derecognized
assets was $4.1 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of
December 31, 2018 was $55 million recorded as gross derivative assets and
$9 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2017,
the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $3.1 billion, and
the fair value of the total return swaps was $89 million recorded as gross
derivative assets and $15 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.
The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the
application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included
primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

237

23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or
geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate
credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure.
Although Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified
along industry, product and geographic lines, material transactions are
completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities
trading, derivatives and foreign exchange businesses.
In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a diversified
portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region,
country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous
basis. At December 31, 2018, Citigroup’s most significant concentration of
credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Company’s
exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued
by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $250.0 billion and
$227.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The German and
Japanese governments and their agencies, which are rated investment grade
by both Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest exposures. The Company’s
exposure to Germany amounted to $46.4 billion and $38.3 billion at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was composed of investment
securities, loans and trading assets. The Company’s exposure to Japan
amounted to $28.8 billion and $25.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively, and was composed of investment securities, loans and
trading assets.
The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to
$27.9 billion and $30.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively,
and was composed of trading assets, investment securities, derivatives and
lending activities.

238

The Company may also apply a price-based methodology, which utilizes,
where available, quoted prices or other market information obtained from
recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics
to the position being valued. The frequency and size of transactions are
among the factors that are driven by the liquidity of markets and determine
the relevance of observed prices in those markets. If relevant and observable
prices are available, those valuations may be classified as Level 2. When that
is not the case, and there are one or more significant unobservable “price”
inputs, then those valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when
less liquidity exists for a security or loan, a quoted price is stale, a significant
adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences
in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued, or prices from
independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation, the “price”
inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are
classified as Level 3.
If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon
internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current
market-based parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and
option volatilities. Items valued using such internally generated valuation
techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver
that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified as Level 3
even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where
possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers. Vendors’
and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from
observed prices to proprietary valuation models, and the Company assesses
the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate
of fair value. The following section describes the valuation methodologies
used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value,
including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each
instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes
details of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models and any
significant assumptions.

24. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a
consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, and therefore
represents an exit price. Among other things, the standard requires the
Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Under ASC 820-10, the probability of default of a counterparty is factored
into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of
Citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at
fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy

ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market
data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs
reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have
created the following fair value hierarchy:

• Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
• Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted

•

prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or
more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers
relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The
frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and the amount of
adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in
determining the relevance of observed prices in those markets.

Market Valuation Adjustments

Determination of Fair Value

Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual
financial instrument. The Company applies market valuation adjustments
that are consistent with the unit of account, which does not include
adjustment due to the size of the Company’s position, except as follows.
ASC 820-10 permits an exception, through an accounting policy election,
to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial
liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are
met. Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments
that meet those criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk
position. The Company applies market valuation adjustments, including
adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position, consistent
with market participant assumptions.

For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures fair
value using the procedures set out below, irrespective of whether the assets
and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether
they are required to be measured at fair value.
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a
market price is available, the Company will make use of acceptable practical
expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the
items are classified as Level 2.

239

The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit
and funding risk, respectively, inherent in the derivative portfolio. However,
most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts
and are not commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments
are normally settled contractually or, if terminated early, are terminated at
a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties. Thus, the CVA and
FVA may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal
course of business. In addition, all or a portion of these adjustments may be
reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the
credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments.
The table below summarizes the CVA and FVA applied to the fair value of
derivative instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as Level 2 or
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the
price at which the net open risk position could be exited. These valuation
adjustments are based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument in the
market. When Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial
investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk position, the
valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position.
Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments
(FVA) are applied to the relevant population of over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk,
own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value. This
principally includes derivatives with a base valuation (e.g., discounted using
overnight indexed swap (OIS)) requiring adjustment for these effects, such
as uncollateralized interest rate swaps. The CVA represents a portfolio-level
adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s
(assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) non-performance risk.
FVA reflect a market funding risk premium inherent in the
uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized
derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes
(CSAs), such as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral
received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA methodology
to estimate a funding exposure profile. The calculation of this exposure

Company to reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties

The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in
CVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges, FVA on derivatives and debt
valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi’s own fair value option (FVO) liabilities
for the years indicated:

• First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the
terms of all individual derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation
or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows
at future points in time. The calculation of this exposure profile considers
the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding, including
pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists
with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements.
Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master
netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set
for this purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject
to nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, point-in-time
future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk and unsecured
funding, rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as
a basis to measure the CVA and FVA.
• Second, for CVA, market-based views of default probabilities derived
from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap (CDS) market
are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one.
Citi’s own-credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS spreads for
the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS
spread indices for each credit rating and tenor. For certain identified
netting sets where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to
counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific CDS spreads are
used. For FVA, a term structure of future liquidity spreads is applied to the
expected future funding requirement.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
No quoted prices exist for these instruments, so fair value is determined using
a discounted cash flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based on the
terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivative or other
features. These cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate
to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying
collateral. Generally, when such instruments are recorded at fair value, they
are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in
the valuation are readily observable. However, certain long-dated positions
are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

When the Company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the
securitization market, the Company uses the securitization price to determine
the fair value of the portfolio. The securitization price is determined from
the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market,
adjusted for transformation costs (i.e., direct costs other than transaction
costs) and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and
liquidity. As a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in
certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007, observable
securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans
have not been readily available. Therefore, such portfolios of loans are
generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. However, for other
loan securitization markets, such as commercial real estate loans, price
verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible, since these
markets have remained active. Accordingly, this loan portfolio is classified as
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
For most of the lending and structured direct subprime exposures, fair
value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available, other
market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other
internal valuation techniques. The valuation of certain asset-backed security
(ABS) CDO positions utilizes prices based on the underlying assets of the
ABS CDO.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities
and Trading Loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets
to determine the fair value of trading securities; such items are classified as
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include government securities
and exchange-traded equity securities.
For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter, the
Company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flows, price-based and internal models. Fair
value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified,
where possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, including
third-party vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and may
apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable.
A price-based methodology utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other
market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with
similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. The yields used in
discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information.
Trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally
classified as Level 2. However, when less liquidity exists for a security or loan,
a quoted price is stale, a significant adjustment to the price of a similar
security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual
security or loan being valued, or prices from independent sources are
insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is generally classified
as Level 3. The price input used in a price-based methodology may be zero
for a security, such as a subprime CDO, that is not receiving any principal or
interest and is currently written down to zero.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using quoted
(i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where available, are classified as
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives
executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques.
These derivative instruments are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3
depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model.
The valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the
nature of the underlying instrument. The principal techniques used to value
these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models, such as
derivative pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations).
The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of
the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign
exchange rates, volatilities and correlation. The Company typically
uses OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of
certain derivatives.

241

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of
non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the
appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such instruments are
generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant
inputs are readily observable.
The Company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments,
including structured liabilities, using the appropriate derivative valuation
methodology (described above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—
Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. Such instruments
are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of
significant inputs to the model.

Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and marketable
equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing
similar procedures described for trading securities above or, in some cases,
using vendor pricing as the primary source.
Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity
and real estate entities. Determining the fair value of nonpublic securities
involves a significant degree of management judgment, as no quoted prices
exist and such securities are generally thinly traded. In addition, there may
be transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The Company’s process
for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted
valuation techniques, including comparables analysis. In determining the
fair value of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events such
as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity
issuances or other observable transactions. Private equity securities are
generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In addition, the Company holds investments in certain alternative
investment funds that calculate NAV per share, including hedge funds,
private equity funds and real estate funds. Investments in funds are generally
classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair
values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per share of the
Company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the
investment will be realized at a price other than the NAV. Consistent with
the provisions of ASU 2015-07, these investments have not been categorized
within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below. See
Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(1) Represents netting of (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a
qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.
(2) Includes positions related to investments in unallocated precious metals, as discussed in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also includes physical commodities accounted for at the lower of cost or fair
value and unfunded credit products.
(3) Reflects the net amount of $43,207 million of gross cash collateral paid, of which $35,666 million was used to offset trading derivative liabilities.
(4) Amounts exclude $0.4 billion of investments measured at NAV in accordance with ASU 2015-07.
(5) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.
(6) Reflects the net amount of $52,840 million of gross cash collateral received, of which $38,532 million was used to offset trading derivative assets.

in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges
are presented gross in the following tables:

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category

The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair value category for

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period
December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018:

• Transfers of Equity Contract Derivatives of $1.1 billion from Level 3 to
•
•

Level 2 related to equity derivatives where the unobservable components
were deemed insignificant.
Transfers of Commodity Contract Derivatives of $2.2 billion from
Level 3 to Level 2 related to commodity derivatives where the unobservable
component of the derivatives were deemed insignificant.
Transfers of Long-Term Debt of $2.9 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, and
of $3.5 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, mainly related to structured debt,
reflecting changes in the significance of unobservable inputs as well as
certain underlying market inputs becoming less or more observable.

•

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017:

• Transfers of Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased

under agreements to resell of $1.2 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, related
to the significance of unobservable inputs as well as certain underlying
market inputs becoming more observable and shortening of the
remaining tenor of certain reverse repos. There is more transparency and
observability for repo curves used in the valuation of structured reverse
repos with tenors up to five years.

The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value
Measurements

The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash instruments and
derivatives of varying complexity. The valuation methodologies used to
measure the fair value of these positions include discounted cash flow
analysis, internal models and comparative analysis. A position is classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one input is
unobservable and is considered significant to its valuation. The specific
reason an input is deemed unobservable varies; for example, at least one
significant input to the pricing model is not observable in the market, at least

The fair value amounts presented in these tables represent the primary valuation technique or techniques for each class of assets or liabilities.
Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding.
When the low and high inputs are the same, there is either a constant input applied to all positions or the methodology involving the input applies to only one large position.
Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments.
For equity securities, the price and fund NAV inputs are expressed on an absolute basis, not as a percentage of the notional amount.
Both trading and nontrading account derivatives—assets and liabilities—are presented on a gross absolute value basis.

Volatility
Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is
a key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on the tenor
of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the
contract. Volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not
observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as
using comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of
market information. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair value
measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.
The general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to
changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level
of the underlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets) benefit
from increases in volatility, whereas short option positions (liabilities) will
suffer losses. Some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility
than others. For example, an at-the-money option would experience a
greater percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money option.
In addition, the fair value of an option with more than one underlying
security (e.g., an option on a basket of bonds) depends on the volatility of the
individual underlying securities as well as their correlations.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to
Unobservable Inputs

Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or disperse market
data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fair-valued
position or portfolio in today’s market. This is especially prevalent in Level
3 fair value instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs
that may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s (or
portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties associated
with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair value measurements may
not be independent of one another. In addition, the amount and direction
of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an
unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as
whether the Company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For
certain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management are sensitive
to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and
aggregation of the individual inputs.
The following section describes some of the most significant unobservable
inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value measurements.
Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change
in relation to each other. A variety of correlation-related assumptions are
required for a wide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets,
foreign exchange options, CDOs backed by loans or bonds, mortgages,
subprime mortgages and many other instruments. For almost all of these
instruments, correlations are not directly observable in the market and must
be calculated using alternative sources, including historical information.
Estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over
time, and calculating correlation information from market data requires
significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market
(e.g., swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate
of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value
measurements is required.
Changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact, favorable
or unfavorable, on the value of an instrument, depending on its nature. A
change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds
comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche.
For example, an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds
would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated
instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of
these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche. That same
change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior
tranches of the same structure.

Yield
In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in the
market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar
securities. This estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the
characteristics of the security being valued. In other situations, the estimated
yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as
well. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of
the security, the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3.
Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal
and interest cash flows on instruments, such as asset-backed securities.
Adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and
relevant credit spreads.
Prepayment
Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the future cash
flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The
effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgage-backed
securities. An increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally
creates losses for the holder of these securities. Prepayment is generally
negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of
low prepayment and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s negative
impact on mortgage securities’ valuation. As prepayment speeds change, the
weighted average life of the security changes, which impacts the valuation
either positively or negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and
the direction of the change in the weighted average life.

255

Recovery
Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan
that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario. For many credit
securities (such as asset-backed securities), there is no directly observable
market input for recovery, but indications of recovery levels are available
from pricing services. The assumed recovery of a security may differ from
its actual recovery that will be observable in the future. The recovery rate
impacts the valuation of credit securities. Generally, an increase in the
recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase
in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount of
principal available for distribution and, as a result, decreases the fair value of
the security.
Credit Spread
Credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality.
Credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment,
delinquency and recovery rates, therefore capturing the impact of other
variables on the fair value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of
securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of
the security. For example, credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair
value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade
bond. Generally, the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more
observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart.

256

The fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible using quoted
secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a
loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted
for the specific attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate
owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on
the fair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend on the type
of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted
market prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation techniques.
Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted
appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 2. Where significant
adjustments are made to the appraised value, the loan is classified as Level 3.
Additionally, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often based
on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of similar assets require
significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying
collateral, these fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3.
The fair value of non-marketable equity securities under the
measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the
identical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an internal valuation
technique in the case of an impairment. Where significant adjustments
are made to the observed transaction price or when an internal valuation
technique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ
from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including
marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the
observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis and therefore are not included in the tables above. These include assets
measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods
as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity
securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and
are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an
impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result
of a transaction observed during the periods for the identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans HFS
and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market.
The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were
still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:

In addition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets and
liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship and intangible
values, which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroup’s financial
position and the value of its net assets.
Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range
of factors, including interest rates, credit quality and market perceptions of
value, and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are
entered into.

of lease finance receivables at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
(2) Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
(3) Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverable and other financial instruments included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the
carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
(4) The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges.
(5) Includes brokerage payables, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate unfunded lending
commitments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were liabilities of $7.8 billion
and $3.2 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified
as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer
unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by
providing notice to the borrower.

The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings, other than DVA,
which is reported in AOCI. Additional discussion regarding the applicable
areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 24 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing
rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of MSRs.

25. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes
in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election
is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial
liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events
occur. The fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is
managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments
that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.
Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in
Principal transactions. The related interest revenue and interest expense are
measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and
are reported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)

Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s liabilities for which
the fair value option has been elected using Citi’s credit spreads observed
in the bond market. Effective January 1, 2016, changes in fair value of fair
value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads
(DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.
Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected (other than non-recourse and similar liabilities) is
impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads.
The estimated changes in the fair value of these liabilities due to such
changes in the Company’s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit
risk) were a gain of $1,415 million and a loss of $680 million for the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in fair value
resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by
incorporating the Company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond
market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as
described above.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated
and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as
guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading
businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and
unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in
the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with
derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return
swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting
mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve
operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending
transactions across the Company.

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements
to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under
Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain
Non-Collateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed
income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities
loaned and certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings held primarily

Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate
Ventures and Certain Equity Method and Other Investments
Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose
of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The Company
has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures, because such
investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund
activities in Citi’s investment companies, which are reported at fair value.
The fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of
these investments. All investments (debt and equity) in such private equity
and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are
classified as Investments on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in Other
revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income.
Citigroup also elected the fair value option for certain non-marketable
equity securities whose risk is managed with derivative instruments that are
accounted for at fair value through earnings. These securities are classified as
Trading account assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes
in the fair value of these securities and the related derivative instruments
are recorded in Principal transactions. Effective January 1, 2018 under ASU
2016-01 and ASU 2018-03, a fair value option election is no longer required
to measure these non-marketable equity securities through earnings. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are
classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of
Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual
interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on Trading account assets
or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit
products. The changes in fair value for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of
$27 million and a gain of $10 million, respectively.
Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver,
platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency
trading activities or to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing
structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt
host contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup
elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the debt
host contract within Trading account assets on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across
unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.4 billion and
$0.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts are
expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future periods.
As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities, Citi trades
unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase
and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When
Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from
its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the
unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the
trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted
for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of December 31,
2018, there were approximately $13.7 billion and $10.3 billion in notional
amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts
outstanding, respectively.

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and
originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage
loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged
with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option
to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is
complex and to achieve operational simplifications.

The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in
Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. There
was no net change in fair value during the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Related interest income
continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported
as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Certain Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain structured
liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation,
currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity risks. The Company
elected the fair value option, because these exposures are considered to be
trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis.
These positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or derivatives
(Trading account liabilities) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
according to their legal form.
The following table provides information about the carrying value of structured notes, disaggregated by type of embedded derivative instrument:

the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s
own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other
changes in fair value will continue to be reported in Principal transactions.
Changes in the fair value of these structured liabilities include accrued
interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in
Principal transactions.

economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used
to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value

mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications. These positions are
reported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair value
attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as
a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value will continue to be

Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured based on
the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

loans, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation requirements under
securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and bank loans.
In addition, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, Citi had pledged

Restricted Cash

Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions)
to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to
meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of
customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements
or debt retirement. Restricted cash includes minimum reserve requirements
with the Federal Reserve Bank and certain other central banks and cash
segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as
required by Citigroup broker-dealers’ primary regulators, including the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom’s Prudential
Regulation Authority.

Guarantees

Citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers
to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety
of business transactions. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a
guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount
of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under
the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The
determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on
the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As
such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated
losses, if any, on these guarantees.

In addition, included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with
banks at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $8.3 billion and $7.4 billion,
respectively, of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations
or deposited with clearing organizations.
Collateral

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the approximate fair value of collateral
received by Citi that may be resold or repledged, excluding the impact of
allowable netting, was $526.0 billion and $457.5 billion, respectively. This
collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, securities
borrowings and loans, securities for securities lending transactions, derivative
transactions and margined broker loans.

(1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees
is minimal.
(2) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $95 billion and $86 billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual
potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
to merchants.

Derivative Instruments Considered to Be Guarantees
Derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a
notional amount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,
where there is little or no initial investment, and whose terms require or
permit net settlement. For a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities, see
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those
instruments that require Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on
changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or
an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More specifically, derivative
instruments considered to be guarantees include certain over-the-counter
written put options where the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or
broker-dealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these
markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying instruments). Credit
derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from the tables above as they are
disclosed separately in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In
instances where Citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited, the
notional amount of the contract is disclosed.

Financial Standby Letters of Credit
Citi issues standby letters of credit, which substitute its own credit for that
of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is obligated
to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults
on contractual obligations. Financial standby letters of credit include
(i) guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks
that support industrial revenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of
payment obligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-thecounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below), (iii) support
options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and
(iv) letters of credit that backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and
trade acceptances.
Performance Guarantees
Performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a
customer’s tender bid on a construction or systems-installation project or to
guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms.
They are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified
products, commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party.

265

Loans Sold with Recourse
Loans sold with recourse represent Citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers
for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause
in a sales agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the
buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be
accomplished by the seller taking back any loans that become delinquent.
In addition to the amounts shown in the tables above, Citi has recorded
a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability
regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related
to its whole loan sales to the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) and, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve was
approximately $49 million and $66 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card
and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total
volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid
charge-back transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2018 and
2017, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $95 billion and
$86 billion, respectively.
However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative
of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience.
This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services
are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are
returned to merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its
contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial
strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and nature of unresolved
charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2018 and
2017, the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of Citi’s contingent
obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial.

Securities Lending Indemnifications
Owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties
who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some
other obligation. Banks may administer such securities lending programs for
their clients. Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to
guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event
that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending
agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of
the security.

Credit Card Arrangements with Partners
Citi, in certain of its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees
to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during
the term of the agreement. To the extent that such origination targets
are not met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain
payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with
such originations.

Credit Card Merchant Processing
Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Company’s indirect
obligations in connection with (i) providing transaction processing services
to various merchants with respect to its private label cards and (ii) potential
liability for bank card transaction processing services. The nature of the
liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a
merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s
favor. The merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In
general, if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this
amount from the merchant, the credit card processing company bears the
loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder.
With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary contingent liability with
respect to its portfolio of private label merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated
as the cash flows between Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis,
and Citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to
the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, Citi may delay settlement, require
a merchant to make an escrow deposit, include event triggers to provide Citi
with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial
deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements
(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the unlikely event
that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a
refund to its private label cardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or
refund cardholders.
With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential liability for bank card
transactions where Citi provides the transaction processing services as well
as those where a third party provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary
guarantor, should that processor fail to perform.

Custody Indemnifications
Custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will
be made whole in the event that a third-party subcustodian or depository
institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets.
Other Guarantees and Indemnifications
Credit Card Protection Programs
Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various cardholder protection
programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide
insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with
purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for
lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total
outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss
cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases
and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify
for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability and amount
of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and
nature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2018 and 2017,
the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi’s
obligations related to these programs were immaterial.

266

Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC
policies. In addition, GE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor
of UFLIC, which is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay
its reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and
the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from UFLIC
(supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the
Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations
now benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither
Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance
agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit indirectly
from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement, which helps assure
that UFLIC will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance
obligations to Genworth.
In connection with Citi’s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife),
Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder
claims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC
policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of Genworth.
In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance business to Brighthouse. As a
result, the Travelers LTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original
reinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth
remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth
Trusts. The fair value of the Genworth Trusts is approximately $7.5 billion as
of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide
collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities
of Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The assets in the
Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the
fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to
these estimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over time.
If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original Travelers/GE
Life reinsurance agreement for any reason, including insolvency or the
failure of UFLIC to perform in a timely manner, and (ii) the assets of the two
Genworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi, through its LTC
reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for any losses
incurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both events would have to
occur before Citi would become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse
pursuant to its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such events
occurring is currently not probable, there is no liability reflected on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 related to
this indemnification. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure
under this indemnification obligation.
Separately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to be purchased by
China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, subject to a series of conditions and
regulatory approvals. Citi is monitoring these developments.

Other Representation and Warranty Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, Citi provides standard representations
and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous
transactions and also provides indemnifications, including indemnifications
that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional
taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse
interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide Citi
with comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties
and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual
relationships, they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the
transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual
terms related to Citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and
are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment
that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure
that terms of a contract are met at inception. No compensation is received
for these standard representations and warranties, and it is not possible to
determine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment.
In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the
indemnification clauses, and the contingencies potentially triggering the
obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. As a
result, these indemnifications are not included in the tables above.
Value-Transfer Networks (VTNs)
Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks
(VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)
around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require
that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by
the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations. Citi’s
potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the
VTNs, contributions to a VTN’s funds, or, in limited cases, the obligation
may be unlimited. The maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this
would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet occurred. Citi
believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the VTNs.
Accordingly, Citi’s participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees
tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2018 or 2017 for potential obligations that could
arise from Citi’s involvement with VTNs associations.
Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification
In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi,
entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its
long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial Inc.,
or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As
part of this transaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two
regulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two collateral
trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are referred to
as the Genworth Trusts.
As part of GE’s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and
rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by
providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth through its Union Fidelity

267

Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing
Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCPs) for clients
that need to clear exchange traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded
that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing
member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the
underlying exchange traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated
Financial Statements. See Note 22 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives
activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities
collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain
circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its
clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at
depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.
There are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains
benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest
spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP
or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables
to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from brokers, dealers
and clearing organizations) or Cash and due from banks, respectively.
However, for exchange traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts
where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances,
the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the
CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with
the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by
the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will
not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into
other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for
the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client
cash balances are legally isolated from Citi’s bankruptcy estate. The total
amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was
approximately $13.8 billion and $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP
to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for
each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to
the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts).
In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out
the client’s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted
by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to
be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash
or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected
to be sufficient to mitigate Citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails
to perform.
As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is
not recognized on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Carrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities
related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above
amounted to approximately $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. The
carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other
liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is
included in Other liabilities.
Collateral
Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these
guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $55 billion and $46 billion at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Securities and other marketable
assets held as collateral amounted to $55 billion and $70 billion at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of collateral is
held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications.
Additionally, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to
$4.1 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain
guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has
not been determined.
Performance Risk
Citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned
referenced counterparty internal or external ratings. Where external ratings
are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above,
while anything below is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal
ratings are in line with the related external rating system. On certain
underlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not available. Such
referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category. The maximum
potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding
guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts, which
is the par amount of the assets guaranteed.
Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of
future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit
ratings. As previously mentioned, the determination of the maximum
potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees
without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or
from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no
relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.

The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers
maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally
have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require
payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon
exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise
is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.

Both secured-by-real-estate and unsecured commitments are included in
this line, as well as undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation
to advance for construction progress payments. However, this line only
includes those extensions of credit that, once funded, will be classified as
Total loans, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Credit Card Lines
Citigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card
lines are cancelable by providing notice to the cardholder or without such
notice as permitted by local law.

Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit
A commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which Citigroup substitutes
its credit for that of a customer to enable the customer to finance the
purchase of goods or to incur other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter
on behalf of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon
presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has performed in
accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. When a letter of credit is
drawn, the customer is then required to reimburse Citigroup.

Commercial and Other Consumer Loan Commitments
Commercial and other consumer loan commitments include overdraft and
liquidity facilities as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase
loans, purchase third-party receivables, provide note issuance or revolving
underwriting facilities and invest in the form of equity.

One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgages
A one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a written
confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will
advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase.

Other Commitments and Contingencies
Other commitments and contingencies include committed or unsettled
regular-way reverse repurchase agreements and all other transactions related
to commitments and contingencies not reported on the lines above.

Revolving Open-End Loans Secured by One- to Four-Family
Residential Properties
Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential
properties are essentially home equity lines of credit. A home equity line
of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the
extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the
first mortgage.

Unsettled Reverse Repurchase and Securities Lending
Agreements and Unsettled Repurchase and Securities
Borrowing Agreements
In addition, in the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse
repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and
securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At December 31,
2018, and 2017, Citigroup had $36.1 billion and $35.0 billion unsettled
reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, respectively, and
$30.7 billion and $19.1 billion unsettled repurchase and securities lending
agreements, respectively. For a further discussion of securities purchased
under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company’s
policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, see
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial Real Estate, Construction and Land Development
Commercial real estate, construction and land development include
unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of
financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land
development projects.

27. CONTINGENCIES

Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies

Overview. In addition to the matters described below, in the ordinary
course of business, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and current
and former officers, directors and employees (for purposes of this section,
sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties) routinely
are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and
proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek
relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection, fair
lending, securities, banking, antifraud, antitrust, anti-money laundering,
employment and other statutory and common laws. Certain of these actual
or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial
or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief,
and in some instances seek recovery on a class-wide basis.
In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and Related Parties also
are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, informationgathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements,
fines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or other relief. In
addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries of Citigroup are banks, registered
broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, investment advisors or
other regulated entities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation
by various U.S., state and foreign securities, banking, commodity futures,
consumer protection and other regulators. In connection with formal and
informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup and such affiliates and
subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders seeking
documents, testimony and other information in connection with various
aspects of their regulated activities. From time to time Citigroup and Related
Parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information
or assistance, formal or informal, from federal or state law enforcement
agencies including, among others, various United States Attorneys’ Offices,
the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and other divisions of
the Department of Justice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of
the United States Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation relating to Citigroup and its customers.
Because of the global scope of Citigroup’s operations, and its presence
in countries around the world, Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to
litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations, informationgathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal) in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that
may differ substantially, and present substantially different risks, from those
Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United States. In some
instances, Citigroup and Related Parties may be involved in proceedings
involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions, which may result
in overlapping, cumulative or inconsistent outcomes.
Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the
manner management believes is in the best interests of Citigroup and its
shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where
applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief
sought as appropriate in each pending matter.

Accounting and Disclosure Framework

ASC 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies,
including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters. ASC 450
defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition, situation, or set of
circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that
will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur.” It imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure
of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent
future event or events. It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the
following three terms: “probable,” meaning that “the future event or events
are likely to occur”; “remote,” meaning that “the chance of the future event
or events occurring is slight”; and “reasonably possible,” meaning that “the
chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less
than likely.” These three terms are used below as defined in ASC 450.
Accruals. ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is
“probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact
of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.” In
accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies,
including the litigation and regulatory matters disclosed herein, when
Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of
the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range
is accrued, unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount within the range. Once established, accruals are
adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information.
The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be
substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters.
Disclosure. ASC 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is
at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have
been incurred” and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions
described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the
amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued
for a matter because Citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but
not probable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable, and
the reasonably possible loss is material, it discloses the loss contingency. In
addition, Citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a
reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount
accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup’s disclosure includes an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as
to which an estimate can be made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate
cannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are
deemed remote.

271

Inherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the matters
disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages.
The claims asserted in these matters typically are broad, often spanning a
multi-year period and sometimes a wide range of business activities, and
the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified
or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim. Other matters
relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings, as to which there may
be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or
other remedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in
such matters, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible,
until developments in the case or investigation have yielded additional
information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range
of reasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among other
things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties, rulings by the court
on key issues, analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement
negotiations. Depending on a range of factors, such as the complexity of
the facts, the novelty of the legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court’s
scheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s
willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months
or years after the filing of a case or commencement of an investigation before
an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made.
Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made. For some of the matters
disclosed below, Citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible
loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For some of the
matters included within this estimation, an accrual has been made because
a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable, but an
exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the
estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued
amount. For other matters included within this estimation, no accrual has
been made because a loss, although estimable, is believed to be reasonably
possible, but not probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably
possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31, 2018, Citigroup estimates
that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to
approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate.
These estimates are based on currently available information. As available
information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will
change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many
estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures
involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty,
estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and
regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For example,
at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may have only preliminary,
incomplete, or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim,
(ii) its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal
on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or
regulators, may prove to be wrong and (iii) the outcomes it is attempting to

predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative
analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that
Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such
an outcome to be remote. For all of these reasons, the amount of loss in
excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate
has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss
included in the estimate.
Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made. For other matters
disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably
possible loss or range of loss. Many of these matters remain in very
preliminary stages (even in some cases where a substantial period of
time has passed since the commencement of the matter), with few or no
substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of
the claims, the class (if any) or the potentially available damages, and fact
discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun. In many of these matters,
Citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or
asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse
party (whether a regulator or a private party). For all these reasons, Citigroup
cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if
any, for these matters.
Opinion of Management as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the
foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup’s management, based on current
knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals, that the
eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely
to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition
of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts
sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such
matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to
time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
ANZ Underwriting Matter

On June 1, 2018, charges were filed by the Australian Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) against Citigroup Global Markets
Australia Pty Limited (CGMA) for alleged criminal cartel offenses following
a referral by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. CDPP
alleges that the cartel conduct took place following an institutional share
placement by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ)
in August 2015, where CGMA acted as joint underwriter and lead manager
with other banks. CDPP has also charged other banks and individuals,
including current and former Citi employees. Charges relating to CGMA are
captioned R v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED
(2018/00175168). The matter is before the Downing Centre Local Court
in Sydney, Australia. Separately, the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission is conducting an investigation, and CGMA is cooperating with
the investigation.

In 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver
for a financial institution, filed a civil action against Citibank in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION AS RECEIVER FOR
GUARANTY BANK v. CITIBANK N.A. The complaint concerns one residential
MBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee, and alleges that
Citibank failed to pursue contractual remedies against the sponsor and
servicers of that trust. After the court granted Citibank’s motion to dismiss
on grounds that the FDIC lacked standing to pursue its claims, the FDIC
filed an amended complaint. In 2018, Citibank filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint. Additional information concerning this action
is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 15-cv-6574
(S.D.N.Y.) (Carter, J.).

Credit Crisis-Related Litigation and Other Matters

Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in numerous legal
actions and other proceedings asserting claims for damages and related relief
for losses arising from the global financial credit crisis that began in 2007.
Citigroup also received subpoenas and requests for information from various
regulatory agencies and other government authorities concerning certain
businesses impacted by the credit crisis. The vast majority of these matters
have been resolved as of December 31, 2018.
Mortgage-Related Litigation and Other Matters
Mortgage-Backed Securities and CDO Investor Actions: Beginning in 2010,
Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in complaints
filed by purchasers of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and credit default
obligations (CDOs) sold or underwritten by Citigroup. The complaints
generally assert that defendants made material misrepresentations and
omissions about the credit quality of the assets underlying the securities or
the manner in which those assets were selected, and typically assert claims
under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, state blue sky laws, and/or
common-law misrepresentation-based causes of action.
All but one of these matters have been resolved through motion practice
or settlement. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate original purchase
amount of the purchases covered by a tolling agreement with an investor
threatening litigation is approximately $500 million.
Mortgage-Backed Securities Trustee Actions: In 2014, investors in 27
residential MBS trusts for which Citibank served or currently serves as trustee
filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, captioned FIXED INCOME SHARES: SERIES M ET AL. v. CITIBANK
N.A., alleging claims that Citibank failed to pursue contractual remedies
against securitization sponsors and servicers. Subsequently, all claims were
dismissed as to 26 of the 27 trusts. On March 22, 2018, the court granted
Citibank's motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs’ motions
for partial summary judgment and class certification, which plaintiffs have
appealed. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available
in court filings under the docket number 14-cv-9373 (S.D.N.Y.) (Furman, J.)
and 18-1196 (2d Cir.).
In 2015, largely the same group of investors filed an action in the
New York State Supreme Court, captioned FIXED INCOME SHARES: SERIES
M, ET AL. v. CITIBANK N.A., related to 24 trusts initially dismissed from the
federal court action and one additional trust, asserting claims similar to the
action filed in federal court. In 2017, the court granted in part and denied
in part Citibank’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint. Citibank
appealed as to the sustained claims, and on January 16, 2018, the New York
State appeals court dismissed all of the remaining claims except the claim
for breach of contract related to purported discovery of alleged underwriter
breaches of representations and warranties. Additional information
concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket
number 653891/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (Ramos, J.).

Tribune Company Bankruptcy
Certain Citigroup affiliates (along with numerous other parties) have been
named as defendants in adversary proceedings related to the Chapter 11
cases of Tribune Company (Tribune) filed in the United States Bankruptcy
Court, asserting claims arising out of the approximately $11 billion leveraged
buyout of Tribune in 2007. The actions were consolidated as IN RE TRIBUNE
COMPANY FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE LITIGATION and transferred to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
In the adversary proceeding captioned KIRSCHNER v. FITZSIMONS,
ET AL., the litigation trustee, as successor plaintiff to the Official Committee
of Unsecured Creditors, seeks to avoid and recover as actual fraudulent
transfers the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part of the
leveraged buyout. Several Citigroup affiliates, along with numerous other
parties, are named as shareholder defendants and are alleged to have
tendered Tribune stock to Tribune as a part of the buyout. In 2017, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed
the actual fraudulent transfer claim against the shareholder defendants,
including the Citigroup affiliates.
Several Citigroup affiliates, along with numerous other parties, are named
as defendants in certain actions brought by Tribune noteholders, which
seek to recover the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part of the
leveraged buyout, as state law constructive fraudulent conveyances. The
noteholders’ claims were previously dismissed, which was affirmed on appeal.
On May 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
withdrew its 2016 transfer of jurisdiction to the district court.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) was named as a defendant in
a separate action in connection with its role as advisor to Tribune. On
January 23, 2019, the court dismissed the action. Additional information
concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the
docket numbers 08-13141 (Bankr. D. Del.) (Carey, J.), 11 MD 02296
(S.D.N.Y.) (Cote, J.), 12 MC 2296 (S.D.N.Y.) (Cote, J.), 13-3992, 13-3875,
13-4196 (2d Cir.) and 16-317 (U.S.).

On December 31, 2018, a group of institutional investors issued (but did
not serve) a claim in the High Court in London against Citibank, Citigroup,
and other defendants, alleging that defendants manipulated, and colluded
to manipulate, the foreign exchange market. Claimants allege breaches
of EU and UK competition law. The case is ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS
GMBH AND OTHERS v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS, case number
CL-2018-000840, and will not commence unless and until it is served.
In 2018, two motions for certification of class actions alleging
manipulation of foreign exchange markets were filed in the Tel Aviv
Central District Court in Israel against Citigroup and CGMI, and
Citibank, respectively. The cases are LANUEL, ET AL. v. BANK OF AMERICA
CORPORATION, ET AL., CA 29013-09-18, and GERTLER, ET AL. v. DEUTSCHE
BANK AG, C1A 1657-10-18.
In 2015, an action captioned NYPL v. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., ET AL.
was brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California (later transferred to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York) against Citigroup, as well as numerous other
foreign exchange dealers. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a third amended class
action complaint, naming Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp as defendants.
Plaintiffs seek to represent a putative class of “consumers and businesses in
the United States who directly purchased supracompetitive foreign currency
at Benchmark exchange rates” from defendants. Plaintiffs allege claims
under federal and California antitrust and consumer protection laws, and
are seeking compensatory damages, treble damages, and declaratory and
injunctive relief. Additional information concerning this action is publicly

on behalf of purported classes of indirect purchasers of foreign exchange
instruments sold by defendants, including Citigroup, Citibank, Citicorp,
and CGMI as defendants, captioned CONTANT, ET AL. v. BANK OF AMERICA
CORPORATION, ET AL. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a
conspiracy to fix currency prices in violation of the Sherman Act and
various state antitrust laws. On November 15, 2018, the court denied
plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of a proposed class settlement
with the Citi defendants and requested plaintiffs to provide additional
information. Additional information concerning these actions is publicly
available in court filings under the docket numbers 16 Civ. 7512 (S.D.N.Y.)
(Schofield, J.), 17 Civ. 4392 (S.D.N.Y.) (Schofield, J.), and 17 Civ. 3139

Depositary Receipts Matters

Regulatory Actions: On November 7, 2018, the SEC entered an order
accepting an offer of settlement from Citibank concerning the SEC’s
investigation into activity relating to pre-released American Depositary
Receipts from 2011 to 2015. Pursuant to the settlement, Citibank paid
$38.7 million in disgorgement and interest.
Other Litigation: In 2015, Citibank was sued by a purported class of
persons or entities who, from January 2000 to the present, are or were holders
of depositary receipts for which Citibank served as the depositary bank and
converted, or caused to be converted, foreign currency dividends or other
distributions into U.S. dollars. On March 23, 2018, the court granted in part
and denied in part plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, certifying only a
class of holders of Citi-sponsored American depositary receipts that plaintiffs
own. On September 6, 2018, the court granted preliminary approval of a class
action settlement. On January 2, 2019, the court granted plaintiffs’ request to
adjourn the final approval hearing for the settlement. Additional information
concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket
number 15 Civ. 9185 (S.D.N.Y.) (McMahon, C.).
Foreign Exchange Matters

Regulatory Actions: Government and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and
in other jurisdictions are conducting investigations or making inquiries
regarding Citigroup’s foreign exchange business. Citigroup is fully
cooperating with these and related investigations and inquiries.
Antitrust and Other Litigation: Numerous foreign exchange dealers
and their affiliates, including Citigroup, Citibank, Citicorp and CGMI, were
named as defendants in putative class actions consolidated in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption
IN RE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BENCHMARK RATES ANTITRUST LITIGATION.
Plaintiffs allege that they suffered losses as a result of defendants’ alleged
manipulation of, and collusion with respect to, the foreign exchange market.
Plaintiffs assert claims under the Commodity Exchange Act, Sherman Act,
and Clayton Act, and seek compensatory damages, treble damages, and
declaratory and injunctive relief.

of an August 2018 settlement with Citi defendants filed a lawsuit against
Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, and other defendants under the caption ALLIANZ
GLOBAL INVESTORS, ET AL. v. BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, ET AL.
Plaintiffs allege that defendants manipulated, and colluded to manipulate,
the foreign exchange market. Plaintiffs assert Sherman Act and unjust
enrichment claims and seek consequential and punitive damages and other
forms of relief. Additional information concerning this action is publicly
available in court filings under the docket number 18 Civ. 10364 (S.D.N.Y.)
(Schofield, J.).

In 2016, Banque Delubac filed a summons against Citigroup, Citigroup
Global Markets Limited (CGML), and Citigroup Europe Plc with the
Commercial Court of Aubenas, France, alleging that defendants suppressed
LIBOR submissions between 2005 and 2012, and that Banque Delubac’s
EURIBOR-linked lending activity was negatively impacted as a result.
Plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages for losses on LIBOR-linked
loans to customers and for alleged consequential losses to its business. On
November 6, 2018, the Aubenas Court found that it lacked subject matter
jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Commercial Court of Marseille.
An appeal on jurisdiction is pending before the Court of Appeal of Nîmes.
Proceedings before the Commercial Court of Marseille are stayed pending the
appeal. The case is SCS BANQUE DELUBAC & CIE v. CITIGROUP INC. ET AL.,

AL., pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, filed a fourth amended complaint naming Citigroup, Citibank,
and various other banks as defendants. Plaintiffs claim to have suffered
losses as a result of purported EURIBOR manipulation and assert claims
under the Commodity Exchange Act, the Sherman Act, and the federal civil

Interchange Fee Litigation

Beginning in 2005, several putative class actions were filed against Citigroup
and Related Parties, together with Visa, MasterCard and other banks and
their affiliates, in various federal district courts and consolidated with other
related individual cases in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. This proceeding
is captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT
DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION.
The plaintiffs, merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard branded
payment cards as well as membership associations that claim to represent
certain groups of merchants, allege, among other things, that defendants
have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant
discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and to restrain trade
unreasonably through various Visa and MasterCard rules governing
merchant conduct, all in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and
certain California statutes. Plaintiffs further alleged violations of Section 2
of the Sherman Act. Supplemental complaints also were filed against
defendants in the putative class actions alleging that Visa’s and MasterCard’s
respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive and violated Section 7
of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard’s initial public offering constituted a
fraudulent conveyance.

275

consolidated class action complaint. On November 20, 2018, the district court
granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss in TRUEEX
LLC v. BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, ET AL. Additional information
concerning these actions is publicly available in court filings under the
docket numbers 18-CV-5361 (S.D.N.Y.) (Engelmayer, J.) and 16-MD-2704
(S.D.N.Y.) (Engelmayer, J.).

In 2014, the district court entered a final judgment approving the terms
of a class settlement providing for, among other things, a total payment to
the class of $6.05 billion; a rebate to merchants participating in the damages
class settlement of 10 bps on interchange collected for a period of eight
months by the Visa and MasterCard networks; and changes to certain network
rules. Various objectors appealed from the final class settlement approval
order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s approval of
the class settlement and remanded for further proceedings. The district
court thereafter appointed separate interim counsel for a putative class
seeking damages and a putative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended
or new complaints on behalf of the putative classes and various individual
merchants were subsequently filed, including a further amended complaint
on behalf of a putative damages class and a new complaint on behalf of
a putative injunctive class, both of which named Citigroup and affiliates.
In addition, numerous merchants have filed amended or new complaints
against Visa, MasterCard, and in some instances one or more issuing
banks. Three of these suits—7-ELEVEN, INC., ET AL. v. VISA INC., ET AL.;
ROUNDY’S SUPERMARKETS, INC. v. VISA INC. ET AL.; and LUBY’S
FUDDRUCKERS RESTAURANTS, LLC, v. VISA INC., ET AL—brought on
behalf of numerous individual merchants, name Citigroup and affiliates
as defendants.
On January 24, 2019, the court granted the damages class plaintiffs’
motion for preliminary approval of a settlement with the defendants,
including Citigroup. The settlement involves the damages class only and does
not settle the claims of the injunctive relief class or any actions brought on a
non-class basis by individual merchants. Additional information concerning
these consolidated actions is publicly available in court filings under the
docket number MDL 05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.).

Money Laundering Inquiries

Regulatory Actions: Citibank has received subpoenas from the United
States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York in connection with its
investigation of alleged bribery, corruption and money laundering associated
with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and
the potential involvement of financial institutions in that activity. The

relationships and transactions at Citibank and its affiliates associated with
certain individuals and entities identified as having had involvement with
the alleged corrupt conduct. Citi is cooperating with the authorities in
this matter.
Oceanografía Fraud and Related Matters

Regulatory Actions: On August 16, 2018, Citi resolved an SEC investigation
into Citigroup’s announcement in the first quarter of 2014 of a fraud
discovered in a Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) supplier program involving
Oceanografía S.A. de C.V. (OSA), a Mexican oil services company and a key
supplier to Pemex. As part of the resolution, Citi agreed to pay a civil penalty
of $4.75 million.
Other Litigation: In 2016, a complaint was filed against Citigroup in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging
that it conspired with OSA and others with respect to receivable financings
and other financing arrangements related to OSA in a manner that injured
bondholders and other creditors of OSA. The complaint asserts claims on
behalf of 39 plaintiffs that are characterized variously as trade creditors
of, investors in, or lenders to OSA. Plaintiffs collectively claim to have lost
$1.1 billion as a result of OSA’s bankruptcy. The complaint asserts claims
under the federal civil RICO law and seeks treble damages and other relief
pursuant to that statute. The complaint also asserts claims for fraud and
breach of fiduciary duty.
Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding common
law claims for fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, and conspiracy on behalf
of all plaintiffs. On January 30, 2018, the court granted Citigroup’s motion
to dismiss the amended complaint, which plaintiffs appealed. Additional
information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings
under the docket number 16-20725 (S.D. Fla.) (Gayles, J.).
In 2017, a complaint was filed against Citigroup in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York by OSA and its controlling
shareholder, Amado Yáñez Osuna. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs were
injured when Citigroup made certain public statements about receivable
financings and other financing arrangements related to OSA. The complaint

Interest Rate Swaps Matters

Regulatory Actions: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
is conducting an investigation into alleged anticompetitive conduct in
the trading and clearing of interest rate swaps (IRS) by investment banks.
Citigroup is cooperating with the investigation.
Antitrust and Other Litigation: Beginning in 2015, IRS market
participants, including Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML and numerous
other parties, were named as defendants in a number of industry-wide
putative class actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption
IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. Plaintiffs in
these actions allege that defendants colluded to prevent the development of
exchange-like trading for IRS, thereby causing the putative classes to suffer
losses in connection with their IRS transactions. Plaintiffs assert federal
antitrust claims and claims for unjust enrichment. Also consolidated under
the same caption are two individual actions filed by swap execution facilities,
asserting federal and state antitrust claims as well as claims for unjust
enrichment and tortious interference with business relations. Plaintiffs in
all of these actions seek treble damages, fees, costs and injunctive relief. On
October 25, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs moved for leave to file a fourth

relief. Defendants filed motions to dismiss on February 23, 2018. Additional
information relating to this action is publicly available in court filings under
the docket number 15-MD-2673 (S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.).
Beginning in 2016, a number of substantially similar putative class action
complaints were filed against a number of financial institutions and traders
related to the supranational, sub-sovereign, and agency (SSA) bond market.
The actions are based upon defendants’ roles as market makers and traders
of SSA bonds and assert claims of alleged collusion under the antitrust
laws and unjust enrichment and seek damages, including treble damages
where authorized by statute, and disgorgement. These actions were later
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that names
Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI and CGML among the defendants. Plaintiffs filed
a second amended consolidated complaint on November 6, 2018, which
defendants moved to dismiss. Additional information relating to this action
is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 16-cv-03711
(S.D.N.Y.) (Ramos, J.).
In 2017, a class action related to the SSA bond market was filed in the
Ontario Court of Justice against Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, Citibank
Canada and Citigroup Global Markets Canada, Inc., among other defendants,
asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of the competition act,
breach of foreign law, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs seek
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory relief. Additional
information relating to this action is publicly available in court filings under
the docket number CV-17-586082-00CP (Ont. S.C.J.).

York against numerous defendants, including Citigroup, CGMI, Citigroup
Financial Products Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.,
Citibanamex, and Grupo Banamex, related to the Mexican sovereign bond
market. The complaints allege a conspiracy to fix prices in the Mexican
sovereign bond market from January 1, 2006 to April 19, 2017, and assert
antitrust and unjust enrichment claims against the Citi defendants, as well as
a number of other banks. Plaintiffs seek statutory treble damages, restitution,
and injunctive relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended
complaint. Additional information relating to this consolidated action is

dismiss, which plaintiffs have appealed. Additional information concerning
this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number
1:17-cv-01434 (S.D.N.Y.) (Sullivan, J.).
Parmalat Litigation

In 2004, an Italian commissioner appointed to oversee the administration
of various Parmalat companies, filed a complaint against Citigroup and
Related Parties alleging that the defendants facilitated a number of frauds by
Parmalat insiders. In 2008, a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup’s favor and
awarded Citi $431 million. Citigroup has taken steps to enforce the judgment
in Italian court. In 2014, an Italian court of appeal affirmed the decision in
the full amount of $431 million, which Parmalat has appealed to the Italian
Supreme Court. Additional information concerning this action is publicly
available in court filings under the docket number 27618/2014.
In 2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian civil court in Milan
claiming damages of €1.8 billion against Citigroup and Related Parties. On
January 25, 2018, the Milan court dismissed Parmalat’s claim on grounds
that it was duplicative of Parmalat’s previously unsuccessful claims. On
March 2, 2018, Parmalat filed an appeal to the Milan Court of Appeal.
Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court
filings under the docket number 1009/2018.
Referral Hiring Practices Investigations

Regulatory Actions: Government and regulatory agencies in the United
States and in other jurisdictions are conducting investigations or making
inquiries regarding Citigroup’s sales and trading activities in connection

Antitrust and Other Litigation: Beginning in 2015, CGMI and numerous
other U.S. Treasury primary dealer banks were named as defendants in a
number of substantially similar putative class actions involving allegations

also alleges that CGMI and other primary dealer defendants colluded to
boycott and prevent the emergence of an anonymous, all-to-all electronic
trading platform in the Treasuries secondary market, and seeks damages,

SUPERVISION, REGULATION AND OTHER
Citi also has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges. In the
U.S., CGMI is a member of the principal U.S. futures exchanges, and Citi
has subsidiaries that are registered as futures commission merchants and
commodity pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC). Citibank, CGMI, Citigroup Energy Inc. and CGML, also are registered
as swap dealers with the CFTC. CGMI is also subject to SEC and CFTC rules
that specify uniform minimum net capital requirements. Compliance
with these rules could limit those operations of CGMI that require the
intensive use of capital and also limits the ability of broker-dealers to
transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates.
See also “Capital Resources” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a further discussion of capital considerations of Citi’s
non-banking subsidiaries.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Citi is subject to regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as
applicable laws in the other jurisdictions in which it does business.
General

Citigroup is a registered bank holding company and financial holding
company and is regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board.
Citigroup’s nationally chartered subsidiary banks, including Citibank, are
regulated and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also has
examination authority for banking subsidiaries whose deposits it insures.
Overseas branches of Citibank are regulated and supervised by the Federal
Reserve Board and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks by the Federal Reserve
Board. These overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated
and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries. In addition,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regulates consumer
financial products and services. Citi is also subject to laws and regulations
concerning the collection, use, sharing and disposition of certain customer,
employee and other personal and confidential information, including those
imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act
and the EU General Data Protection Regulation. For more information on
U.S. and foreign regulation affecting or potentially affecting Citi, see “Risk
Factors” above.

Transactions with Affiliates

Transactions between Citi’s U.S. subsidiary depository institutions and their
non-bank affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, and are
generally required to be on arm’s-length terms. See also “Managing Global
Risk—Liquidity Risk” above.
COMPETITION

Citi, including its banking subsidiaries, is subject to regulatory limitations,
including requirements for banks to maintain reserves against deposits,
requirements as to liquidity, risk-based capital and leverage (see “Capital
Resources” above and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the
interest that may be charged and limitations on investments that can be
made and services that can be offered. The Federal Reserve Board may
also expect Citi to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in certain
circumstances. Citi is also subject to anti-money laundering and financial
transparency laws, including standards for verifying client identification at
account opening and obligations to monitor client transactions and report
suspicious activities.

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Citi’s competitors
include a variety of financial services and advisory companies. Citi competes
for clients and capital (including deposits and funding in the short- and
long-term debt markets) with some of these competitors globally and with
others on a regional or product basis. Citi’s competitive position depends
on many factors, including, among others, the value of Citi’s brand
name, reputation, the types of clients and geographies served; the quality,
range, performance, innovation and pricing of products and services; the
effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, technology advances,
customer service and convenience; the effectiveness of transaction execution,
interest rates and lending limits; and regulatory constraints. Citi’s ability to
compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract new employees

Securities and Commodities Regulation

PROPERTIES

Citi conducts securities underwriting, brokerage and dealing activities in the
U.S. through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), its primary brokerdealer, and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, which are subject to regulations
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority and certain exchanges. Citi conducts similar
securities activities outside the U.S., subject to local requirements, through
various subsidiaries and affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets
Limited in London (CGML), which is regulated principally by the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.
in Tokyo, which is regulated principally by the Financial Services Agency
of Japan.

Citi’s principal executive offices are currently in New York City at 388
Greenwich Street and are owned and fully occupied by Citi.
Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.’s principal executive offices are
in New York City at 388 Greenwich Street and are owned and fully occupied
by Citi.
Citigroup’s principal executive offices in EMEA are at 25 and 33
Canada Square in London’s Canary Wharf, with both buildings subject to
long-term leases.

Other Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation

289

In Asia, Citi’s principal executive offices are in leased premises at
Champion Tower in Hong Kong. Citi has other significant leased premises,
including in Singapore, Manila and Japan. Citi has major or full ownership
interests in country headquarter locations in Shanghai, Seoul, Kuala
Lumpur and Mumbai.
Citi’s principal executive offices in Mexico, which also serve as the
headquarters of Citibanamex, are owned and located in Mexico City. Citi’s
principal executive offices for Latin America (other than Mexico) are in
leased premises in Miami.
Citi also owns or leases over 52 million square feet of real estate in
95 countries, consisting of over 7,500 properties.
Citi continues to evaluate its global real estate footprint and space
requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its
premises are no longer necessary. There is no assurance that Citi will be
able to dispose of any excess premises or that it will not incur charges in
connection with such dispositions, which could be material to Citi’s operating
results in a given period.
Citi has developed programs for its properties to achieve long-term
energy efficiency objectives and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to
lessen its impact on climate change. These activities could help to mitigate,
but will not eliminate, Citi’s potential risk from future climate change
regulatory requirements.
For further information concerning leases, see Note 26 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE
IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN
RIGHTS ACT

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human
Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual
or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly
engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with
individuals or entities that are subject to sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure
is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were
conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi, in its related quarterly
report on Form 10-Q, previously disclosed reportable activities pursuant to
Section 219 for the second and third quarters of 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, Citibank Europe plc, a subsidiary of
Citibank, acting as an intermediary bank processed a transaction between
two Irish banks involving the Iranian Embassy in Ireland. The total value
of the payment was EUR 90.00 (USD 104.24). This transaction was for
visa-related fees and is exempt pursuant to the travel exemption of the
Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations. Citibank Europe plc
realized nominal fees for the processing of this payment.

Dividends

In addition to Board of Directors’ approval, Citi’s ability to pay common
stock dividends substantially depends on regulatory approval, including
an annual regulatory review of the results of the CCAR process required by
the Federal Reserve Board and the supervisory stress tests required under
the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital
planning and stress testing, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory
Capital Standards—Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” and
“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above. Any dividend on Citi’s outstanding
common stock would also need to be made in compliance with Citi’s
obligations to its outstanding preferred stock.
For information on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary depository
institutions to pay dividends, see Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
