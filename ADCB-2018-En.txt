WHAT WE DID IN 2018

Generate sustainable
profit growth through
a UAE-centric
approach

We are committed to the UAE and
its economy. It provides a dynamic,
growing market with great ambition
and significant long-term business
potential as it continues to diversify.
Dedicating ourselves to this one
market gives us a sharp focus on the
developing needs of our customers.

• Growing customer base with more than 886,000
customers, with 49 branches in the UAE

We have a diversified liability base
with increasing customer deposits.
Loan growth is funded through
growth in customer deposits, which
resulted in a significant improvement
in our loan-to-deposit ratio since the
launch of our strategy.

• Customer deposits increased by 8% over 2017 to
AED 177 billion, comprising 72% of total liabilities

Superior customer
experience through
service excellence

Effective risk-taking
and management in
line with a predefined
risk appetite

Our disciplined approach to risk
management is fundamental to
protecting the Bank’s long-term
financial strength and has given us the
flexibility to adjust to the challenges
of the operating environment.

• Cost of risk improved to 0.57% from 0.81% in 2017

Exploitation of

Calculated as the growth in share price, plus dividends paid to shareholders
during the year. TSR is recognised as one of the best measures of
shareholder returns.

2017

Calculated by dividing operating expenses by operating income.
We are re-engineering our operational processes and increasing automation
in order to do more with less. We are becoming more efficient, which
provides greater scope to invest in our businesses.
Basic earnings per share (EPS)
Calculated as profit attributed to equity shareholders, divided by
the weighted average of the shares in issue during the year.

Most resilient

Net Promoter Score (NPS)
NPS is based on the likelihood that customers will recommend ADCB to
family or a friend.

Best customer
service

NPS is calculated as the percentage of customers who are promoters,
rating ADCB a 9 or 10 on a 0 to 10-point scale, minus the percentage who
are detractors, rating it 6 or lower.

Since 2015 ADCB’s NPS Scores
have improved significantly
across all areas of the business
(see below)

According to leading consultants, an increase of five points year on year
is widely regarded as a significant achievement.

RISK
MANAGEMENT

Risk management is
a critical part of our
successful strategy,
protecting the Bank
and enabling us to grow
more effectively and
with greater security.

ADCB 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Risk is an integral part of our business and
decision-making process. Our performance
depends on our ability to manage risk at every
level. As a consequence, we have a robust
risk management governance structure and
framework that allows us to maintain a crucial
balance between risk and reward.

Operating expenses for 2018 were

prior year. Staff expenses were up
8% at AED 1.838 billion, as the Bank
continued to invest in recruiting
and retaining top talent to further
enhance business capabilities and
support growth, as well as investing
in significant resources to excel
in customer service, operational
excellence and digital transformation.
General and administrative expenses
were at par with prior year. Cost to

2017

IMPROVED COST OF RISK
Net impairment charges were
AED 1.266 billion, 24% lower than
2017, translating to an annualised cost
of risk of 0.57% compared to 0.81% in
2017. The continued de-risking of the
unsecured retail portfolio resulted in a
much improved cost of risk for 2018.
As at 31 December 2018, stage 3/nonperforming loan ratio (NPL) was 2.88%
compared to 2.12% as at 31 December

Effective 1 January 2018, the Bank
successfully transitioned to the IFRS 9
accounting standard. Under IFRS 9,
impairment allowances against loans

CONSUMER BANKING
GROUP (CBG)

As a retail banking business, our success is
driven by our customer-centric approach,
where we aim to provide the best customer
experience at every interaction. Despite the
sustained downturn, with uncertainty in
the jobs market and a cautious consumer
attitude to spending, ADCB remains the
leading retail asset player in the market.

WHAT WE DO
The Consumer Banking Group supports our retail and
high-net-worth customers with a range of specialist
products and services in conventional and Shari’ahcompliant banking. We have 49 branches across the
UAE, two branches in India and one branch in Jersey.
In addition, we have representative offices in London
and Singapore, four digital banking centres, 376 ATMs,
a 24/7 contact centre, leading online and mobile
banking applications and a strong direct sales force.

Consumer Banking Group reported a net profit of AED 1.198 billion,
12% higher than prior year. Operating income for the Group stood
at AED 3.918 billion and accounted for 43% of total operating
income in 2018. Deposits from customers increased by 2%
over 2017 to AED 52 billion. Meanwhile, low-cost retail current
and savings account (CASA) deposits constituted 71% of total
Consumer Banking deposits as at 31 December 2018. Net loans
to customers fell by 4% to AED 70 billion, primarily on account
of the continued de-risking of the unsecured retail portfolio,
while we maintained our focussed approach to growing the
UAE National segment.
CHANNEL CONVENIENCE
Our investment in, and focus on, digital transformation is part of
our strategic drive to simplify the client experience. It has given
customers greater control over their money and made banking
faster, easier and more secure. It also helps to secure our position
as a leader in the digital banking space, creating a stronger, more
agile business able to swiftly take advantage of opportunities
in the UAE.
We are in pilot stage with ADCB Hayyak«—«a platform which
significantly enhances the onboarding process for new customers,
reducing the time to open an account from 3–4 days to about
10 minutes.
The launch of our MoneyBuddy app was another hit with customers.
The personal finance management tool allows customers to
analyse their spending, manage expenses, and set savings goals.
Uptake for this application has already been strong.

GROUP (WBG)

The strength and quality of our
relationships, particularly with large
corporates, the government and GREs,
has been the driving force behind our
growth over the past year. Not only have
we continued to support them with
financing in a relatively muted economic
environment, but we have also grown
into new and profitable areas of business.
Further, we remained very supportive
to SMEs and mid-corporates as one of the
largest providers of credit to these clients
in the country.

WHAT WE DO
We provide a full portfolio of services, including
world-class transaction banking and investment
banking, to our client franchise as well as having a
market-leading business across all segments in the
market we serve. Our clients range from governmentrelated entities (GREs) to financial institutions, large
corporates, mid-sized corporates and small-tomedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Wholesale Banking
Group is responsible for our branches in India, as well
as representative offices in London and Singapore.
We continue to benefit from our strategic transaction
banking relationships with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Banco Santander and Korea’s Kookmin Bank.

In 2018, Wholesale Banking Group delivered a net profit of
AED 1.707 billion and an operating income of AED 3.005 billion,
an increase of 17% and 10% respectively over 2017. Customer
deposits grew 11% to AED 76 billion, and net loans expanded by
6% over 2017 to AED 96 billion as at 31 December 2018.
While showing tentative signs of recovery in places, the economy
remains difficult for many. The market for good quality credit

has been increasingly competitive as more and more banks have
followed ADCB’s lead in de-risking their book across the
wholesale segments.
As important building blocks for future prosperity and the
diversification of the economy, the SME and mid-corporates
markets remain an area of focus for us and where we have
materially grown market share. The ongoing challenges in the
economy and stricter credit criteria have made it a difficult year
for many of these businesses but we are fully committed to
continuing our strategic and financial support in these sectors.

management and a healthy investment
book, coupled by FX trading opportunities
and a growth in product sales yielded
strong results across the year.

WHAT WE DO
We offer both conventional and Islamic solutions
spanning foreign exchange, money markets, fixed
income, interest rate, currency and commodity
derivatives along with investment and risk
management solutions.

Net profit of AED 1.830 billion and operating income of
AED 2.036 billion grew by 17% and 14% respectively over
the previous year.
Over 2018, ADCB continued to be a leading UAE Bank with its
liquidity management framework through the implementation
of globally recognised practices. The liquidity framework aims to
optimise the Bank’s balance sheet whilst adhering to Basel III
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR)
regulatory measures.
In the capital markets, we delivered a number of landmark
transactions that contributed to a very positive year. In the
Swiss franc bond market, we completed two deals worth
CHF 175 million and CHF 100 million and we returned to the
US markets for a five-year USD 750 million 144A transaction.
Elsewhere we concluded a syndicated loan specifically for Asian
banks that raised USD 590 million and we returned to the
Taiwanese market for a USD 540 million Formosa bond issuance.
Our success in the global marketplace is a testament to the
strength of our brand, as well as our growing international
recognition and reputation. We remain active in the international
bond and equity investor space where we typically hold more
than 100 sessions and events to highlight the opportunities we
can deliver.

We recognise the importance of

WHAT ARE THE TOPICS?
As you might expect, the subjects that are most
important to each group are many and varied. These
are some of the key issues that are of most interest
to our stakeholders:

HOW DO WE ENG AGE?
Our methods of engagement vary depending on
the stakeholder group and include a wide range
of communication, from face to face meetings to
written, verbal and broadcast communication, town
hall sessions, presentations, reports, roadshows,
forums, and more.
LOOKING AHE AD
In 2019, we will provide a more detailed report on
our engagement with these groups. We will identify
the ways in which we engaged with each of them,
how frequently we did so, the key topics raised, and
the feedback received, as well as how we responded
to them.

CHAIRMAN’S
LETTER

The rapid pace of change in the
world of banking and beyond
provides our industry with challenges
and opportunities. It also highlights
the importance of our strong and
experienced Board.

Good governance is the foundation of our
success, underpinning our strategy and guiding
our steps to becoming the number one bank
of choice in the UAE.
As we build on our strategy and continue to
transform our business, particularly in the digital
space, the Board is responsible for navigating
issues today that will help define and direct our
ambitions tomorrow. That is why a rich range of
experiences and skills, a disciplined approach to
governance and a deep understanding of banking
are vital components for a successful Board.
Over the next few pages you will be able to
see how we have continued to strengthen our
corporate governance through the activities
of our Board and Board Committees. The
implementation and transition to IFRS 9,
new regulatory liquidity requirements, better
communication and transparency are among
the many topics we addressed during 2018.

ADCB supports levels of remuneration

ADCB 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Fixed Pay
Definition

Components

2018 Key Management Fixed Pay

Fixed pay is based on the market rate for
each role and is impacted by the employee’s
contributions over time.
Fixed-pay reviews depend on whether the
employee achieved specific and measurable
objectives and delivered a prescribed
performance level.

Basic Salary Allowances
• Social allowance (UAE Nationals)
• Job-specific allowances (such as a teller
allowance, remote-area allowance or
shift allowance)
Benefits based on band, such as:
• Leave fare
• Private medical insurance
• Life insurance coverage
• Education allowance
• Annual leave

In 2018, Key Management (defined as the
Group CEO and his direct reports) received
fixed pay and cash benefits in an aggregate
amount of AED 28.795 million.

Definition

Performance Criteria

2017 Variable Pay Awards

Employees may receive variable pay based
on their performance over the year. Because
it is performance-based, variable pay is at risk,
and the amount received, if any, may change
each year.

Individual award amounts are dependent
on three things:
• Individual performance
• Business function performance
• Bank overall performance
For more information, see ADCB’s Variable
Pay Framework & Governance—Key Facts,
on page 114.

For performance in 2017, awards to
employees in 2018 consisted of cash
variable pay awards of AED 140.96 million
and deferred compensation plan awards
of AED 46.58 million.
Key Management received AED 26.035
million in cash and AED 20.315 million in
deferred compensation from the amounts
set forth above.

Definition

Selection Criteria

2018 Retention Scheme Awards

In 2014, ADCB introduced a share-based
Retention Scheme for incumbents in key
positions deemed ‘mission critical’ and for
UAE Nationals deemed to have exceptional
growth potential.
The Retention Scheme, which is independent
of variable pay awards, is designed to ensure
business continuity by mitigating turnover
risk and the related operational risk. Invitations
to join the Retention Scheme are at the sole
discretion of the NCHR Committee; members
of the Management Executive Committee
are not eligible to participate. Retention
Scheme awards vest after four years from
the award date.

• Incumbents in ‘mission critical’ positions
• UAE Nationals with exceptional growth
potential

In 2018, we awarded AED 14.95 million under
the retention scheme.
Awards were made to 95 employees,
of whom 75% were UAE Nationals.

• Risk; and
• Learning and Growth.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VARIABLE

Effectiveness of the Variable Pay Framework is monitored
on an annual basis through a set of KPIs, including:
• correlation between total variable pay pool and
the Bank’s Net Profits;
• correlation between individual performance and

• attrition rate for the employees awarded deferred
variable pay as compared to the overall attrition rate; and
• Leadership Stability-Attrition rate at senior management

First-time adoption of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments — Estimation uncertainty
with respect to the transition effect of expected credit losses (ECL) on loan and
advances to customers
AREA OF FOCUS

The Bank adopted the IFRS 9: Financial Instruments from
1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts previously
recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the
Bank elected not to restate the comparative figures and
recorded an adjustment of AED 1.5 billion to its opening
retained earnings as at 1 January 2018.

The changes required to processes, systems and controls
to comply with IFRS 9 were complex and significant, as
the standard requires a fundamental change to the way,
when Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are recognised and
how these are measured. There was a risk that inadequate data as well as lack of uniformity in the data makes
it difficult to develop models, which are sufficient for
IFRS 9 impairment requirements. Moreover, differences
between regulatory requirements for provisioning and
IFRS 9 with respect to Probability of Default (PD) and Loss
given Default (LGD), and also non-availability of past data

127

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
and models for determining forward-looking estimates
may limit the precision of credit risk systems. The Bank
was also required to make a number of judgements,
assumptions and estimates, which includes adopting a
‘default’ definition and developing PDs at origination,
lifetime-PDs, and macroeconomic models with a number
of scenarios and probabilities for each scenario and other
post-model adjustments and management overlays.
The Bank also applied proxies and practical expedients
in certain situations where sufficient historical or future
data is not available without undue cost or effort. There
was also a risk that as at 1 January 2018 that the Bank
used hindsight, especially while performing the staging
assessment of loans and advances to customers.
The Bank’s transitional disclosures to IFRS 9 are included
in Note 3.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

We considered the appropriateness of key technical
decisions, judgments and accounting policy elections
made by the Bank to ensure compliance with IFRS 9
impairment requirements. We involved our credit risk
modelling specialists in the consideration of principal
credit risk modelling decisions against requirements of
the accounting standard and industry practice.
We understood and evaluated, with the assistance of our
specialists, the models developed for ECL calculations,
assumptions and data used by the Bank for impairment
measurement, which included the evaluation of the
process for reflecting forward looking macroeconomic
scenarios and models for exposures arising from loan
commitments and financial guarantee contracts. We
re-performed certain model calculations to confirm the
risk parameter outputs and ECL amounts, and found the
results were appropriate.

OUR AUDIT APPROACH

We tested the recognition of post model adjustments
and management overlays in the context of key model
and data limitations identified by the Bank, focusing on
PD and LGD used for corporate loans, challenged their
rationale and recalculated where necessary. We also
considered the Bank’s internal controls and governance

processes and systems under the new accounting standard and evaluated the impact on related IT systems and
risks arising from IT in conjunction with our IT specialists.
The transition to the new impairment model was prepared
under an interim control environment where models
went through ongoing validation during the reporting
period. We therefore updated our views regarding the risk
associated with the transition to IFRS 9 impairment model
to be significant.

Loan loss impairments — Estimation uncertainty with respect to impairment
allowances for loan and advances to customers
AREA OF FOCUS

The assessment of the Bank’s determination of impairment allowances for loans and advances to customer
requires management to make significant judgements
over the staging of financial assets and measurement of
the Expected Credit Loss (ECL). The audit was focused
on this matter due to the materiality of the loans and
advances to customers (representing 59.5% of total assets)
and the complexity of the judgements, assumptions and
estimates used in the ECL models.

that judgements, assumptions, estimates, proxies and
practical expedients implemented at the transition date,
are not consistently applied throughout the reporting
period or there are any unjustified movements in management overlays.

The material portion of the non-retail portfolio of loans
and advances is assessed individually for the significant
increase in credit risk (SICR) and measurement of ECL.

notional amounts held (AED 696 billion).
The Bank holds or issues derivative contracts for trading
purpose, and also for hedging customers’ exposures or to
hedge its own books. The valuation of these instruments
remains a complex area, in particular when the fair value
is established using a valuation technique due to the
instrument’s complexity or due to the lack of availability
of market-based data. Those valuations involve significant
judgements over the selection of an appropriate valuation
methodology and inputs used in the models.

Due to the complexity of the above matters, our audit was
focused on testing the valuation methodology of derivative financial instruments and ensuring the qualification of
hedge accounting.

IT systems and controls over financial reporting
AREA OF FOCUS

We identified IT systems and controls over financial
reporting as an area of focus because the Bank’s financial
accounting and reporting systems are vitally dependent
on complex technology due to the extensive volume and
variety of transactions which are processed daily and
there is a risk that automated accounting procedures and
related internal controls are not accurately designed and
operating effectively. A particular area of focus related
to logical access management and segregation of
duties. The underlying principles are important because
they ensure that changes to applications and data are
appropriate, authorised and monitored. In particular, the
incorporated relevant controls are essential to limit the
potential for fraud and error as a result of change to an
application or underlying data.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH

Our audit approach relies on automated controls and
therefore procedures were designed to test access and
control over IT systems. Given the IT technical characteristics of this part of the audit, we involved our IT audit
specialists. Our audit procedures included:

• Update the IT understanding on applications relevant to
financial reporting including Swift/FTS messaging and
the infrastructure supporting these applications;
• Test of IT general controls relevant to automated controls and computer-generated information covering
access security, program changes, data centre and
network operations;
• Examine computer generated information used in
financial reports from relevant applications and key
controls over their report logics;
• Assess the reliability and continuity of the information
system environment;
• Perform testing on the key automated controls on significant IT systems relevant to business processes; and
• Perform journal entry testing as stipulated by the
International Standard on Auditing.

assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying

ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK PJSC
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the purpose of SPPI test, principal is the fair value of the
financial asset at initial recognition. That principal amount
may change over the life of the financial asset (e.g. if there
are repayments of principal). Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk
associated with the principal amount outstanding during
a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks
and costs, as well as a profit margin. The SPPI assessment
is made in the currency in which the financial asset is
denominated.

(b) FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL

Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with
a basic lending arrangement. Contractual terms that
introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual
cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or
commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash
flows that are SPPI. An originated or an acquired financial
asset can be a basic lending arrangement irrespective
of whether it is a loan in its legal form. An assessment of
business models for managing financial assets is fundamental to the classification of a financial asset. The Group
determines the business models at a level that reflects
how groups of financial assets are managed together to
achieve a particular business objective. The Group’s business model does not depend on management’s intentions
for an individual instrument, therefore the business model
assessment is performed at a higher level of aggregation
rather than on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

These assets are measured at fair value, with any gains/
losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit
or loss.

The Group has more than one business model for managing its financial instruments which reflects how the Group
manages its financial assets in order to generate cash
flows. The Group’s business models determine whether
cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash
flows, selling financial assets or both.
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Group determines whether newly recognised financial assets are part
of an existing business model or whether they reflect the
commencement of a new business model. The Group
reassess its business models during each reporting period
to determine whether the business models have changed
since the preceding period.

Financial assets at FVTPL are:
(i) assets with contractual cash flows that are not
SPPI; or/and
(ii) assets that are held in a business model other than
held to collect contractual cash flows or held to
collect and sell; or
(iii) assets designated at FVTPL using the fair value option.

(c) RECLASSIFICATIONS

If the business model under which the Group holds
financial assets changes, the financial assets affected are
reclassified. The classification and measurement requirements related to the new category apply prospectively
from the first day of the first reporting period following
the change in business model that results in reclassifying
the Group’s financial assets. Changes in contractual cash
flows are discussed under the accounting policy on modification and derecognition of financial assets.
(d) IMPAIRMENT

The Group recognises allowances for expected credit loss
(ECLs) on the following financial instruments that are not
measured at FVTPL:
• balances with central banks;
• deposits and balances due from banks;
• reverse-repo placements;
• debt investment securities;
• loans and advances to customers;
• loan commitments issued; and
• financial guarantee contracts issued.
No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments.

With the exception of purchased or originated credit

allowance at an amount equal to:
• 12-month ECL that result from those default events
on the financial instrument that are possible within
12 months after the reporting date, (referred to as
Stage 1); or
• full lifetime ECL that result from all possible default
events over the life of the financial instrument, (referred
to as Stage 2 and Stage 3).

144

ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK PJSC
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2018

A loss allowance for full lifetime ECL is required for a
financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial
instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, ECLs are
measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL. More
details on the determination of a significant increase in
credit risk are provided in Note 3.6(h).
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the present
value of credit losses. These are measured as the present
value of the difference between the cash flows due to
the Group under the contract and the cash flows that
the Group expects to receive arising from the weighting
of multiple future economic scenarios, discounted at
the asset’s EIR. However, for unfunded exposures, ECL is
measured as follows:

credit-impaired at each reporting date. To assess if sovereign and corporate debt instruments are credit impaired,
the Group considers factors such as bond yields, credit
ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise funding.
A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is
granted to the borrower due to a deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition, unless there is evidence that as
a result of granting the concession the risk of not receiving
the contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and
there are no other indicators of impairment. For financial
assets where concessions are contemplated but not
granted, the asset is deemed credit impaired when there
is observable evidence of credit-impairment including
meeting the definition of default. The definition of default
(see below) includes unlikeliness to pay indicators and a
backstop if amounts are overdue for 90 days or more.

When assessing if the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit
obligation, the Group takes into account both qualitative
and quantitative indicators. The information assessed
depends on the type of the asset, for example, in corporate lending a qualitative indicator used is the breach

of covenants, which is not relevant for retail lending.
Quantitative indicators, such as overdue status and nonpayment on another obligation of the same counterparty
are key inputs in this analysis. The Group uses a variety of
sources of information to assess default which are either
developed internally or obtained from external sources.

The qualitative factors that indicate significant increase
in credit risk are reflected in PD models on a timely basis.

However the Group still considers separately some
qualitative factors to assess if credit risk has increased
significantly. For corporate lending there is particular

the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on
the financial instrument at the reporting date based
on the remaining maturity of the instrument with the
risk of a default occurring that was anticipated for the
remaining maturity at the current reporting date when the
financial instrument was first recognised. In making this
assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and
qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable,
including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort, based
on the Group’s historical experience and expert credit
assessment including forward-looking information. For
corporate lending, forward-looking information includes
the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s
counterparties operate, obtained from economic expert
reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies and other
similar organisations, as well as consideration of various
internal and external sources of actual and forecast
economic information. For retail lending, forward looking
information includes the same economic forecasts as corporate lending with additional forecasts of local economic
indicators, particularly for regions with a concentration to
certain industries, as well as internally generated information of customer payment behaviour. Refer Note 42
for more details about forward looking information and
criteria used to determine significant increase in credit risk.
Multiple economic scenarios form the basis of determining the probability of default at initial recognition and at
subsequent reporting dates. Different economic scenarios will lead to a different probability of default. It is the
weighting of these different scenarios that forms the basis
of a weighted average probability of default that is used to
determine whether credit risk has significantly increased.
Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in
credit risk is presumed if a customer is more than 30 days
past due in making a contractual payment.

(i) MODIFICATION AND DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

Modification of financial assets
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a financial
asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between
initial recognition and maturity of the financial asset. A
modification affects the amount and/or timing of the
contractual cash flows either immediately or at a future
date. In addition, the introduction or adjustment of
existing covenants of an existing loan would constitute a
modification even if these new or adjusted covenants do
not yet affect the cash flows immediately but may affect
the cash flows depending on whether the covenant is or
is not met (e.g. a change to the increase in the interest rate
that arises when covenants are breached).
The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial
difficulty to maximise collection and minimise the risk
of default. A loan forbearance is granted in cases where
although the borrower made all reasonable efforts to pay
under the original contractual terms, there is a high risk of
default or default has already happened and the borrower
is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The
revised terms in most of the cases include an extension
of the maturity of the loan, changes to the timing of the
cash flows of the loan (principal and interest repayment),
reduction in the amount of cash flows due (principal and
interest forgiveness) and amendments to covenants.
When a financial asset is modified the Group assesses
whether this modification results in derecognition. In
accordance with the Group’s policy a modification results
in derecognition when it gives rise to substantially different terms. To determine the substantially different terms
the Group considers the qualitative factors (i.e. contractual cash flows after modification, change in currency or
counterparty, interest rates, maturity, covenants) and a

as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market

value of the liability). This is unless such a presentation
would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in
which case the gains or losses attributable to changes
in the credit risk of the liability are also presented in the
profit or loss;
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract
is discharged, cancelled or expires).
The exchange between the Group and its original lenders
of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as
well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing
liabilities, are accounted for as an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and a recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the
discounted present value of the cash flows under the new
terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and
discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at
least 10% different from the discounted present value of
the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.
In addition, other qualitative factors such as, currency
that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the
type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to
the instrument and change in covenants are also taken
into consideration. If an exchange of debt instruments or
modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any cost or fees incurred is recognised as part of
the gain or loss on extinguishment. If an exchange or
modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment,
any cost or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of
the liability and are amortised using EIR method over the
remaining term of the modified liability.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the
dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing
at the statement of financial position date. Any resulting
exchange differences are included in the consolidated
income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at historical exchange rates or year-end
exchange rates if held at fair value, as appropriate. The
resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised
in either consolidated income statement or consolidated
other comprehensive income statement depending upon
the nature of the asset or liability.
In the consolidated financial statements, the results and
financial positions of branches and subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not AED, are translated into the
Group’s presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange prevailing
at the statement of financial position date;
(b) income and expenses at the average rates of exchange
for the reporting period; and
(c) all resulting exchange differences arising from the
retranslation of opening assets and liabilities and
arising from retranslation of the result for the reporting
period from the average rate to the exchange rate
prevailing at the period end are recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity
under ‘foreign currency translation reserve’ (Note 22).
On disposal or partial disposal (i.e. of associates or jointly
controlled entities not involving a change of accounting basis) of a foreign operation, exchange differences
relating thereto and previously recognised in reserves are
recognised in the consolidated income statement on a
proportionate basis, except in the case of partial disposal
(i.e. no loss of control) of a subsidiary that includes a
foreign operation, where the proportionate share of
accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to
non-controlling interests and are not recognised in the
consolidated income statement.

Securities sold subject to a commitment to repurchase
them at a predetermined price at a specified future date
(repos) are continued to be recognised in the consolidated
statement of financial position and a liability is recorded
in respect of the consideration received under borrowings. The difference between sale and repurchase price
is treated as interest expense using the effective interest
rate yield method over the life of the agreement. Assets
purchased with a corresponding commitment to resell
at a specified future date (reverse repos) are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Amounts placed under these agreements are included in
reverse-repo placements. The difference between purchase and resale price is treated as interest income using
the effective yield method over the life of the agreement.

The Group measures its financial assets and liabilities at

3.11 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, balances held with central banks, deposits and balances due
from banks, due to banks, items in the course of collection from or in transmission to other banks and highly
liquid assets with original maturities of less than three
months from the date of acquisition, which are subject
to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are
used by the Group in the management of its short-term
commitments. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at
amortised cost in the statement of financial position.

When there is no quoted price in an active market, the
Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use
of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of
unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all the factors that market participants would
take into account into pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction
price, i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or
received. If the Group determines that the fair value at

3.22 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Cost
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset.
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income
statement so as to write off the depreciable amount of
property and equipment over their estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method. The depreciable amount
is the cost of an asset less its residual value. Land is not
depreciated.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Furniture, equipment and vehicles

3 to 5 years

Computer equipment, software and
accessories

3.21 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES
Investment property is property held either to earn rental
income or for capital appreciation or both, but not for sale
in the ordinary course of business, use in the production

on fair value at the statement of financial position date.
Refer Note 3.13 for policy on fair valuation.

Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by
changing the depreciation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.

is ready for use, capital work in progress is transferred to
the appropriate property and equipment category and

An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can
be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected
future economic benefits that are attributable to it will
flow to the Group. Intangible assets acquired separately
or in a business combination (other than goodwill) are
measured on initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment loss.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be
either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite
lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at the
end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of
future economic benefits embodied in the asset are
accounted for by changing the amortisation period
or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in
accounting estimates and accounted for on a prospective
basis. The amortisation expense on intangible assets
with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income
statement.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when
no future economic benefits are expected from use.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset,
are recognised in consolidated income statement when
the asset is derecognised.

3.26 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
The purchase method of accounting is used to account
for business acquisitions by the Group. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration
given at the date of exchange. The acquired identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured
at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of
the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s
share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of
acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired, the difference is recognised
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill acquired on business combination is carried
at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the
business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is
allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination.
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently
when there is indication that the unit may be impaired. If
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is
less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the
unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset
in the unit. Any impairment loss of goodwill is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. An
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in
subsequent periods.
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.

3.27 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

At each consolidated statement of financial position
date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its
non-financial assets to determine whether there is any

risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.

gains and losses comprise experience adjustments (the
effects of differences between the previous actuarial
assumptions and what has actually occurred), as well as
the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss
is recognised in the consolidated income statement,
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount,
in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

The Group provides end of service benefits for its expatriate employees. The entitlement to these benefits is based
upon the employees’ length of service and completion of
a minimum service period. The expected costs of these
benefits are accrued over the period of employment.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, such that the increased carrying amount does
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal
of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement, unless the relevant asset is carried
at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

(b) Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit
plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive
obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are
recognised as an employee benefit expense in consolidated income statement in the periods during which
services are rendered by employees.
Pension contributions are made by the Group to the Abu
Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund for UAE
citizens in accordance with UAE Federal Law No. 7 of 1999
and to respective pension authorities for other employees
including GCC Nationals as per applicable laws.

3.28 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
(i) Employees’ end of service benefits
(a) Defined benefit plan

(ii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when
the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either
terminate employment before the normal retirement date,
or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer
made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination
benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the
Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is
probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number
of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are
payable more than 12 months after the reporting date,
then they are discounted to their present value.

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit
plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in
respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the
reporting period together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting

any, is recognised in the consolidated income statement
over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding
adjustment to the employees’ incentive plan reserve.

Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated
as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised
immediately. This includes any award where non–vesting
conditions within the control of either the entity or the
counterparty are not met. However, if a new award is
substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as
a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the
cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award, as described in the
previous paragraph.

3.30 SEGMENT REPORTING
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group
that is engaged either in providing products or services
(business segment), or in products or services within
a particular economic environment (geographical
segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are
different from those of other segments. Refer to Note 38
on Business Segment reporting.

countries in which the Group operates.

3.29 PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation
can be made. Where a provision is measured using the
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when
the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a
contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting
its obligation under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net
cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is
established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on
the assets associated with that contract.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a
third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset only if it
is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and
the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

3.32 REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised.
(i) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense for all financial instruments
except for those classified as held for trading or those
measured or designated at fair value through profit or
loss (FVPTL) are recognised in ‘net interest income’ as
‘interest income’ and ‘interest expense’ in the profit or loss
account using the effective interest method. Interest on
financial instruments classified as held for trading or those
measured or designated at FVTPL is recognised in ‘Net
gains from trading securities’ under ‘Net trading income’.
The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash flows of the financial
instrument through the expected life of the financial
instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to
the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial
liability. The future cash flows are estimated taking into
account all the contractual terms of the instrument. The

VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES

The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for the
instrument being measured in an actively traded market.
In the event that the market for a financial instrument is
not active, a valuation technique is used. The majority of
valuation techniques employ only observable market data
and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.
However, certain financial instruments are valued on the
basis of valuation techniques that include one or more
significant market inputs that are unobservable. Valuation
techniques that rely to a greater extent on unobservable
inputs require a higher level of management judgement
to calculate a fair value than those based wholly on
observable inputs.

The fair values of investment properties is based on the
highest and best use of the properties, which is their
current use. The fair valuation of the investment properties is carried out by independent valuers based on
models whose inputs are observable in an active market
such as market conditions, market prices, future rental
income, etc.
The fair value movements on investment properties are
disclosed in more detail in Note 13.

FORWARD AND FUTURES TRANSACTIONS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT MODELS

Currency forwards represent commitments to purchase foreign and domestic currencies, including
non-deliverable forward transactions (i.e. the transaction
is net settled). Foreign currency and interest rate futures
are contractual obligations to receive or pay a net amount
based on changes in currency rates or interest rates or to
buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a
future date at a specified price established in an organised
financial market. The credit risk for futures contracts is
negligible as they are collateralised by cash or marketable
securities and changes in the futures’ contract value are
settled daily with the broker. Forward rate agreements
are individually negotiated interest rate futures that call
for a cash settlement at a future date for the difference
between a contracted rate of interest and the current
market rate based on a notional principal amount.

For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as
generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can
generally be verified and model selection conforms to
market practice. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less
liquid markets with limited pricing information and the
determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Subsequent to initial recognition, the
Group only updates valuation inputs when corroborated
by evidence such as similar market transactions, thirdparty pricing services and/or broker dealer quotations
or other empirical market data. In the absence of such
evidence, Management’s best estimates are used.

OPTION TRANSACTIONS
Foreign currency and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants

either to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) at or by
a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of
a foreign currency or a specific rate of interest or any

currency rate and interest rate risks. In all such cases, the
hedging relationship and objectives including details of
the hedged item and hedging instrument are formally
documented and the transactions are accounted for

Derivative contracts can be exchange traded or OTC. The
Group values exchange traded derivatives using inputs
at market-clearing levels. OTC derivatives are valued
using market based inputs or broker/dealer quotations.
Where models are required, the Group uses a variety of
inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, market
volatilities, yield curves and other reference market data.

DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The Group provides gratuity benefits to its eligible
employees in UAE. The most recent actuarial valuations
of the present value of the defined benefit obligation
were carried out in the last quarter of 2018 by a registered
actuary in the UAE. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation and the related current and past
service cost, were measured using the Projected Unit
Credit Method.
Key assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are as
follows:
Discount rate:

4.00% p.a.

Salary increment rate: 3.00% p.a.
Demographic assumptions for mortality and retirement
were used in valuing the liabilities and benefits under
the plan.

24. Employees’ incentive plan shares, net
The Group operates Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) to recognise and retain good performing employees.
Under the Plan, the employees are granted shares of the Bank when they meet the vesting conditions at a price
prevailing at the grant date. These shares are acquired and held by a subsidiary of the Bank until vesting conditions are
met. The Group’s Nomination, Compensation and HR Committee determines and approves the shares to be granted
to employees based on the Group’s key performance indicators.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Group had three incentive plans in force as described below:

Card related fees
4,000,000 thousand (the “Notes”).
The Notes are non-voting, non-cumulative perpetual
securities for which there is no fixed redemption date.
Redemption is only at the option of the Bank. The Notes
are direct, unsecured, subordinated obligations of the
Bank and rank pari passu without any preference among
themselves and the rights and claims of the Note holders
will be subordinated to the claims of Senior Creditors. The
Notes bore interest at the rate of 6% per annum payable
semi-annually until February 2014, and bear a floating
interest rate of six month Eibor plus 2.3% per annum
thereafter. However the Bank may at its sole discretion
elect not to make a coupon payment. The Note holders
do not have a right to claim the coupon and an election
by the Bank not to service the coupon is not considered
an event of default. In addition, there are certain circumstances (“non-payment event”) under which the Bank is
prohibited from making a coupon payment on a relevant
coupon payment date.

the Board maintains awareness of other commitments
of its Directors and senior management. The Bank has
implemented a Directors’ conflict of interest policy and,
for senior management, a Code of Conduct. As a result

of written declarations submitted by each of the Board
members, the Board satisfies itself that the other commitments of the Directors do not conflict with their duties or
that, where conflicts arise, the Board is sufficiently aware

CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS
Credit-related commitments include commitments to
extend credit, letters of credit and guarantees which are
designed to meet the requirements of the Bank’s customers. Irrevocable commitments to extend credit represent
contractual commitments to make loans and advances
and revolving credits. Revocable commitments to extend
credit represent commitments to make loan and advances
and revolving credits which can be cancelled by the Bank
unconditionally without any contractual obligations.
Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates or other
termination clauses. Since commitments may expire
without being drawn upon, the total contract amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

The following summary describes the operations in each
of the Group’s reportable segments:
Consumer
banking

comprises of retail, wealth management, Islamic financing and investment
in associate. It includes loans, deposits and other transactions and balances
with retail customers and corporate and
private accounts of high net worth individuals and fund management activities.

Wholesale
banking

comprises of business banking, cash
management, trade finance, corporate
finance, small and medium enterprise
financing, investment banking, Indian
operations, Islamic financing, infrastructure and asset finance, government and
public enterprises. It includes loans,
deposits and other transactions and balances with corporate customers.

Letters of credit and guarantees commit the Bank to
make payments on behalf of customers contingent upon
the failure of the customer to perform under the terms
of the contract. These contracts would be exposed to
market risk if issued or extended at a fixed rate of interest.
However these contracts are primarily made at float- Investments
ing rates.
and treasury
Commitments and contingent liabilities which have been
entered into on behalf of customers and for which there
are corresponding obligations from customers, are not
included in assets and liabilities. The Bank’s maximum
exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance
by the other party and where all counterclaims, collateral
or security proves valueless, is represented by the contractual nominal amount of these instruments included
in the table above. These commitments and contingent
obligations are subject to the Bank’s normal credit
approval processes.

38. Operating segments

Property
management

The Group has four reportable segments as described
below. These segments offer different products and services and are managed separately based on the Group’s
management and internal reporting structure. The
Group’s Management Executive Committee (the Chief
Operating Decision Maker “CODM”), is responsible for
allocation of resources to these segments, whereas, the
Group’s Performance Management Committee, based on
delegation from CODM reviews the performance of these
segments on a regular basis.

comprises of central treasury operations,
management of the Group’s investment
portfolio and interest rate, currency
and commodity derivative portfolio
and Islamic financing. Investments and
treasury undertakes the Group’s funding
and centralised liquidity management
activities through borrowings, issue of
debt securities and use of derivatives
for risk management. It also undertakes
trading and corporate finance activities
and investing in liquid assets such as
short-term placements, corporate and
government debt securities.
comprises of real estate management and
engineering service operations of subsidiaries — Abu Dhabi Commercial Properties
LLC, Abu Dhabi Commercial Engineering
Services LLC and rental income of ADCB.

Information regarding the results of each reportable
segment is shown below. Performance is measured based
on segment profit before income tax, as included in the
internal management reports that are reviewed by the
Performance Management Committee. Segment profit is
used to measure performance as management believes
that such information is the most relevant in evaluating
the results of certain segments relative to other entities
that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing
is determined on an arm’s length basis.

The Management level committees also actively manage
risk particularly the Assets and Liabilities Management
Committee (ALCO), Management Risk & Credit Committee
(MRCC) and Management Recoveries Committee (MRC).
The Risk Management function headed by the Group’s
Chief Risk Officer reports independently to BRCC. The
risk function is independent of the origination, trading
and sales function to ensure balance in risk reward decision is not compromised and to ensure transparency of
decisions in accordance with laid down standards and
policies. The risk function exercises control over credit,
market, liquidity, operational, compliance and information security risk. The Risk function is also independent
of the credit underwriting division which is headed by the
Group Chief Credit Officer.

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will
default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial
loss to the Group. The Group’s main income generating
activity is lending to customers and therefore credit risk
is a principal risk. Credit risk mainly arises from loans and
advances to customers and other banks (including related
commitments to lend such as loan or credit card facilities),
investments in debt securities and derivatives that are an
asset position. The Group considers all elements of credit
risk exposure such as counterparty default risk, geographical risk and sector risk for risk management purposes.

Some of these grades are further sub-classified with a plus or a minus sign. Lower grades are indicative of a lower
likelihood of default. Credit grades 1–7 are assigned to performing customers or accounts while credit grades 8 — 10
are assigned to non-performing or defaulting customers.
Credit ratings are used by the Group to decide the maximum lending amount per customer group and also to set
minimum pricing thresholds. Retail customers or individual borrowers are not assigned a credit rating under this
structure. However, retail banking division uses behaviour scoring for its customers.
The internal credit grade system is not intended to replicate external credit grades but factors used to grade a borrower
may be similar, a borrower rated poorly by an external rating agency is typically assigned a higher internal credit grade.
The quality of credit risk exposure is disclosed in Note 42.2.

DEFAULT — STAGE 3

As explained in Note 3.6, the Group monitors all financial
assets that are subject to impairment requirements to
assess whether there has been a significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition. If there has been a
significant increase in credit risk, the Group will measure
the loss allowance based on lifetime rather than
12-month ECL.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment,
the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial
asset has increased significantly since initial recognition
when contractual payments are more than 30 days past
due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable
information that demonstrates otherwise.

SICR — FROM STAGE 1 TO STAGE 2 FOR RETAIL LOANS AND
ADVANCES AND CREDIT CARDS

The Group has monitoring procedures in place to make
sure that the criteria used to identify significant increases
in credit risk are effective, meaning that significant
increase in credit risk is identified before the exposure
• greater than 30 dpd;
is defaulted or when the asset becomes 30 days past
• at least three times 30 dpd or more in the last 12 months; due. The Group performs periodic back-testing of its
ratings to consider whether the drivers of credit risk that
• at least two times 60 dpd or more in the last 12 months. led to default were accurately reflected in the rating in a
timely manner.
In addition to above rating deterioration criteria, the
Group also considers other qualitative SICR indicators as
suggested in IFRS 9 and Central Bank of UAE guidelines.
Criteria to determine whether credit risk has increased
significantly are as follows:

INCORPORATION OF FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION
The Group uses forward-looking information that is
available without undue cost or effort in its assessment
of significant increase of credit risk as well as in its measurement of ECL. The Group employs experts who use
external and internal information to generate a ‘base case’
scenario of future forecast of relevant economic variables
along with a representative range of 3 to 5 other possible
forecast scenarios to model the non-linear impact of
assumptions about macroeconomic factors on ECL. The
external information used includes economic data and
forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities.

The Group applies probabilities to the forecast scenarios
identified. The base case scenario is the single most-likely
outcome and consists of information used by the Group
for strategic planning and budgeting. The Group has
identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and
credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments
and, using a statistical analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables
and credit risk and credit losses.

The Group has not made any material change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions during the
reporting period. The table below summarises the principal macroeconomic indicators included in the economic
scenarios used at December 31, 2018 for the years 2019 to 2022, for UAE which is the country where the Group
operates and therefore is the country that has a material impact on ECLs.

Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various portfolios of financial assets

MEASUREMENT OF ECL

are based on market data (where available), as well as
internal data comprising both quantitative and qualitative
factors. PDs are estimated considering the contractual
maturities of exposures and estimated prepayment rates.
The estimation is based on current conditions, adjusted
to take into account estimates of future conditions that
will impact PD.

The key inputs used for measuring ECL are:
• probability of default (PD);
• loss given default (LGD); and
• exposure at default (EAD).
These figures are generally derived from internally
developed statistical models and other historical data
and they are adjusted to reflect probability-weighted
forward-looking information.

LGD is an estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based
on the difference between the contractual cash flows due
and those that the lender would expect to receive, taking
into account cash flows from any collateral. The LGD
models for secured assets consider forecasts of future

ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK PJSC
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2018

models for unsecured assets consider time of recovery,
recovery rates and seniority of claims. The calculation is
on a discounted cash flow basis, where the cash flows are
discounted by the original EIR of the loan.
EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default
date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of
principal and interest, and expected drawdowns on committed facilities. The Group’s modelling approach for EAD
reflects expected changes in the balance outstanding
over the lifetime of the loan exposure that are permitted
by the current contractual terms, such as amortisation
profiles, early repayment or overpayment, changes in
utilisation of undrawn commitments and credit mitigation
actions taken before default. The Group uses EAD models
that reflect the characteristics of the portfolios.
The Group measures ECL considering the risk of default
over the maximum contractual period (including extension options) over which the entity is exposed to credit
risk and not a longer period, even if contact extension
or renewal is common business practice. However, for
financial instruments such as credit cards, revolving credit
facilities and overdraft facilities that include both a loan
and an undrawn commitment component, the Group’s
contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the
undrawn commitment does not limit the Group’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For
such financial instruments the Group measures ECL over
the period that it is exposed to credit risk and ECL would
not be mitigated by credit risk management actions, even
if that period extends beyond the maximum contractual
period. These financial instruments do not have a fixed
term or repayment structure and have a short contractual cancellation period. However, the Group does not
enforce in the normal day-to-day management the
contractual right to cancel these financial instruments.
This is because these financial instruments are managed
on a collective basis and are cancelled only when the
Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at
the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking
into account the credit risk management actions that the
Group expects to take to mitigate ECL, e.g. reduction in
limits or cancellation of the loan commitment.

The ECL calculation for accounting purposes is different
to the provision calculation for regulatory purposes,
although many inputs used are similar. The Group has
ensured that the appropriate methodology is used
when calculating ECL for both accounting and regulatory purposes.
The measurement of ECL is based on probability weighted
average credit loss. As a result, the measurement of the
loss allowance should be the same regardless of whether
it is measured on an individual basis or a collective basis
(although measurement on a collective basis is more
practical for large portfolios of items). In relation to the
assessment of whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk it can be necessary to perform the
assessment on a collective basis as noted below.

GROUPINGS BASED ON SHARED RISKS
CHARACTERISTICS
For assessing the significant increase in credit risk and
for the measurement of ECL on a collective basis, the
financial instruments are grouped on the basis of shared
risk characteristics, such as:
• product type;
• credit risk grade;
• collateral type;
• date of initial recognition;
• economic sector/industry;
• geographic location of the borrower;
• income bracket of the borrower; and
• the value of collateral relative to the financial asset if it
has an impact on the probability of a default occurring
(loan-to-value (LTV) ratios).
The groupings are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure
that each group is comprised of homogenous exposures.

characteristics or such counterparties are engaged in similar activities or operate in the same geographical areas or
economic sectors that would impact their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes
in economic or other conditions. The analysis of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location

42.5 CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT AND
MITIGATION POLICIES

WRITE-OFF

Loans and advances to customers is the main source of
credit risk although the Group can also be exposed to
other forms of credit risk through, for example, loans
to banks, loan commitments and debt securities. The
Group’s risk management policies and processes are
designed to identify and analyse risk, to set appropriate
risk appetite and to monitor the risks and adherence to
limits by means of reliable and timely data. The Group
assesses the probability of default of individual counterparties using internal rating tools tailored to the various
categories of counterparties.
Exposure to credit risk is also managed through regular
analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet interest and capital repayment obligations
and by changing the lending limits where appropriate.
COLLATERAL

The Group holds collateral against various credit
risk exposures in the form of mortgage interests over
property, other registered securities over assets, fixed
deposits and guarantees. Estimates of fair value of the
collateral (including shares) are updated on a regular basis.
Collateral generally is not held over loans and advances to
banks, except when securities are held as part of reverse
repurchase and securities borrowing activity. The principal collateral types for loans and advances are:
• Cash and marketable securities;
• Mortgages over residential and commercial properties;
• Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable;
• Charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities; and
• Guarantees.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to
engage in a repayment plan with the Group. The Group
categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a
debtor fails to make contractual payments greater than
180 days past due for retail and SME loans. Where loans
or receivables have been written off, the Group continues
to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover
the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are
recognised in profit or loss.
REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT

If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a
subsequent period, and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment
was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing
the loan impairment allowance account accordingly.
The write-back is recognised in the consolidated income
statement in the period in which it occurs.
DERIVATIVES

The Group maintains strict control limits on net open
derivative positions (i.e. the difference between purchase
and sale contracts), by both amount and term. At any
time, the amount subject to credit risk is limited to the
current fair value of instruments that are favourable to the
Group (i.e. positive fair value of assets), which in relation
to derivatives is a small fraction of the contract or notional
values used to express the volume of instruments outstanding. This credit risk exposure is managed as part of
the overall lending limits with customers together with
potential exposures from market movements.
Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in
cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a
corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities. Daily
settlement limits are established for each counterparty to
cover the aggregate of all settlement risks arising from the
Group’s market transactions on any single day.

The estimated fair value of collateral and other security enhancements held against various credit risk The following table represents internal credit ratings of
exposures for the year ended December 31, 2018 was derivative financial instruments:
AED 178,273,983 thousand (December 31, 2017 — AED
2018
2017
183,993,759 thousand).
AED’000
AED’000
Collateral held as security against impaired loans primarily relates to commercial and residential properties and
securities. Where the estimated fair value of collateral
held exceeds the outstanding loan, any excess on realisation is paid back to the customers and is not available for
offset against other loans.

DECEMBER 31, 2018

MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS

The Group further restricts its exposure to credit losses
by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties with which it undertakes a significant volume of
transactions. Master netting arrangements do not generally result in an offset of statement of financial position
assets and liabilities, as transactions are usually settled on
a gross basis, hence the impact of netting in practice is
immaterial.
However, the credit risk associated with favourable
contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to
the extent that if a default occurs, all amounts with the
counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis.
The Group’s overall exposure to credit risk on derivative
instruments subject to master netting arrangements can
change substantially within a year, as it is affected by each
transaction subject to the arrangement.

43. Interest rate risk framework,
measurement and monitoring
Interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial
instruments and reflects the possibility that changes in
interest rates will adversely affect the value of the financial
instruments and the related income. The Group manages
this risk principally through monitoring interest rate gaps
and by matching the re-pricing profile of assets and
liabilities.
Overall interest rate risk positions are managed by the
Group’s Treasury division, which uses derivative instruments like interest rate swaps and cross currency interest
rate swaps to manage the overall interest rate risk arising
from the Group’s interest bearing financial instruments.

Financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk
are financial assets and financial liabilities with either a
fixed or a floating contractual rate of interest. A significant

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities as at December 31, 2018 and
2017 based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations. As interest payments up to contractual maturity
are included in the table, totals do not match with the consolidated statement of financial position. The contractual
maturities of liabilities have been determined based on the remaining period at the consolidated statement of
financial position date to the contractual maturity date and do not take into account the effective expected maturities.
Derivative financial instruments held for trading are included in “less than 3 months” column at their fair value. The
Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Group could be required to
pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Group’s deposit retention history.

risk, because no single measure can reflect all aspects of
market risk. The Group uses various matrices, both statistical and non-statistical, including sensitivity analysis.

47. Operational risk management

• As the second line of defence, Group Operational Risk
Management (“GORM”) is responsible for setting and
maintaining the standards for operational risk management and control. This includes defining appropriate
policies and providing tools to manage and monitor
operational risks within the Group’s activities as well
as providing consolidated operational risk reporting to
the Group Management and the Board of Directors.
GORM function is well supported by the first line
Business Operational Risk Managers, for identifying and
escalating risks that are material to the Group and for
maintaining an effective control environment across the
organisation. The business lines’ inputs to and outputs
from the Group’s risk management and risk measurement and reporting systems are adequately challenged
by the second line GORM. New products, material
process changes and critical outsourcing arrangements
are also assessed and authorised in accordance with
the Compliance Enterprise Risk Advisory and Internal
Control process and product governance policies and
procedures. Operational risk reporting is an integral
part of the governance framework. On a quarterly
basis reporting is done to the Heads of Business Group,
Senior Management Committees and the Board Risk
Committee.

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or
from external events. Operational risks can arise from all
business processes and activities carried out by the Group
and can expose the Group to potentially large losses,
legal suits, regulatory criticism and reputational damage.
The Group manages operational risk exposures through

ment, the Group uses the standardised approach.
Operational risk: Basel III includes a capital requirement for operational risk, again utilising three levels of
sophistication. The capital required under the basic indicator approach is a simple percentage of gross revenues,
whereas under the standardised approach it is one of
three different percentages of total operating income
under each of eight defined business lines. Both these
approaches use an average of the last three financial
years’ revenues. The Group has adopted the standardised
approach in determining the operational risk capital
requirements.

The UAE Central Bank vide its circular No. 60/2017 dated

Assessment Process (ICAAP) requirements since March
2010. For operational risk, the Central Bank of the United
Arab Emirates has given banks the option to use the Basic
Indicators approach or the Standardised approach and
the Group has chosen to use the Standardised approach.

The Group’s capital management is driven by long/short
term strategies and organisational requirements with due
consideration to the regulatory, economic and commercial environment in which the Bank operates.
The Group seeks to optimise returns on capital and it has
always been the objective to maintain a strong capital
base to support business development and to meet regulatory capital requirements at all times.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION
The allocation of capital between specific operations and
activities is, to a large extent, driven by optimisation of
the return achieved on the capital allocated. The amount
of capital allocated to each operation or activity is based
primarily upon the regulatory capital and the Group’s
business strategy, but in some cases the regulatory
requirements do not reflect fully the varying degree of
risk associated with different activities. In such cases the
capital requirements may be flexed to reflect differing risk
profiles, subject to the overall level of capital to support
a particular operation or activity not falling below the
minimum required for regulatory purposes. The process
of allocating capital to specific operations and activities
is undertaken independently of those responsible for the
operation by Bank Risk & Credit and Finance functions
and is subject to review by the ALCO as appropriate.
