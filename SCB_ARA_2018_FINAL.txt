Group Chairman’s statement

Group Chairman’s statement

A more innovative and resilient bank
capable of stronger growth
I was convinced when I became Group
Chairman that Standard Chartered was a
unique organisation with huge potential based
on its extraordinary network across many of
the most dynamic economies in the world.
This opinion is now more resolute than ever,
having seen the Group strengthen its
foundations and position itself for stronger
and more sustainable growth. One of our
Board’s key priorities is to ensure we do
everything we can to help continue to unlock
this potential in pursuit of Our Purpose –
driving commerce and prosperity through
our unique diversity.
This means that as well as our ﬁduciary
responsibilities to our investors, we have a
tremendous responsibility to the communities
and societies in which we operate. Two-thirds
of the global population live in our fastgrowing markets, and many have living
standards below that which they deserve.
We are committed to promoting sustainable
economic and social development that
improves the lives of people across our
communities and transforms our markets
for the better.

Progress during 2018
This year’s performance was delivered
against a largely supportive external
environment, but the global economy began
to lose some steam as the year progressed,
mainly due to two factors. Firstly, the
continued trade tensions between the United

States and China, which have signiﬁcantly
impacted market conﬁdence and – in some
cases – demand. And secondly, the tighter
ﬁnancial conditions we have seen in both
emerging and developing markets as the
US Federal Reserve gradually increased
interest rates during the year.
This is the third year of our current strategy,
and our 2018 results reﬂect further signiﬁcant
progress against our 2015 strategic priorities.
Given the improved performance the Board
has declared a ﬁnal ordinary dividend of
15 cents per share, which would result in a
full-year dividend for 2018 of 21 cents per
share, approximately double the full-year
dividend paid last year. We intend to increase
the full-year dividend per share over time, as
I described in my statement last year. As we
progress in the execution of our strategy and
build towards a 10 per cent return on tangible
equity, the full-year dividend per share has
the potential to double by 2021. To the extent
additional capital generated over that period
is not needed to fund further business
growth, the Board will consider optimal ways
of returning the excess to shareholders.
The Board has also decided to adopt a
formulaic approach to setting the interim
dividend starting this year, being one-third
of the prior year full-year dividend per share.
We have stronger foundations across all
dimensions. Income is growing at a rate
greater than our costs, credit impairment
has notably reduced, underlying proﬁts have
increased signiﬁcantly and our return on

tangible equity has improved. But we have
not yet reached our objective of achieving
double-digit returns. Our shareholders expect
this of us and we are determined to deliver it.
We have continued to plant the seeds that
will deliver better performance over time.
During 2018, we worked to make the bank
a better organisation, capable of growing
faster by strengthening our performance
culture, becoming increasingly client-centric,
focusing on the long term, innovating across
many fronts and becoming simpler, faster and
better. We delivered a negative shareholder
return in 2018 in weak global equity market
conditions, after two consecutive years of
positive progress. I can assure you getting
back to growth in that regard is an important
Board priority.

Outlook for 2019
While uncertainties, mostly linked to
geopolitical and political factors, have
increased and global growth has moderated
and become less balanced, the global
economy is still expected to advance at a
reasonably strong rate. The markets in our
footprint continue to lead global growth, and
substantial opportunities remain across them.
While we are of course not able to shape the
external environment, there is much we can
do to continue to grow strongly, in a safe
and sustainable manner. Later in this report,
Bill will set out the areas on which we will
focus to develop the Group over the next
three years with a view to further improving
ﬁnancial returns.
We must also take time to step back and
consider the longer-term regulatory, political,
economic, technological and societal drivers
of change shaping our business and assess
the impact on us. This ensures we will be
able to combine the best of the old – in
connecting people through trade and
commerce – together with the best of the
new in innovation, digital technologies and
increasing client-centricity. It also enables us
to prepare both for the opportunities of the
future and the inevitable challenges, which
put a premium on both agility and resilience.

ﬁnancial crime remains paramount to us,
both in our operations and in leading
and partnering in initiatives to combat it
more effectively.

We must also consider how we see the
balance between returns and risk. In this
context, the Board is supportive of an
environment where our colleagues feel freer
to innovate, collaborate and grow within the
limits deﬁned by our Risk Appetite.

Our enhanced Risk Appetite Statement and
our improved attention to non-ﬁnancial risks
are two further key areas which make us
stronger, and we have also passed the latest
round of the Bank of England stress tests
without any caveats.

Strengthening our defences
This year, we have been encouraged by the
signiﬁcant further progress we have made in
improving our Risk Management Framework
across all dimensions, alongside our stronger
capital and liquidity position. The ﬁght against

That said, we are by no means complacent.
One risk domain which remains top of
mind is cyber risk. We continue to expand
our capabilities in this area and enhance
our operating models to strengthen our
defences and keep pace with ever-evolving
cyber threats.

This year, we launched our refreshed public
Position Statements, which cover new and
tightened requirements that must be met
before we can undertake business in
industries with high-potential environmental or
social impact. This includes our position on
power generation, which states we will cease
providing ﬁnancing for new coal-ﬁred power
plants anywhere in the world, save where
there is an existing commitment.
In 2018, we celebrated 15 years of our
Seeing is Believing initiative, surpassing our
$100 million fundraising target in the ﬁght
against avoidable blindness. The efforts and
commitment of our colleagues, as well as the
support of our partners, meant that Seeing
is Believing has been able to reach more
than 176 million people across 37 countries,
supported 4.6 million sight-restoring surgeries
and trained more than 334,000 health
workers since 2003. This is a proud moment
for us, and I would like to thank our colleagues
for their dedication and the difference they
have made to the lives of individuals across
our markets.

Governance and culture
A strong culture and robust governance are
essential. The Board continues to strive for a
culture of open communication and challenge
inside the boardroom, where the Board can
hold management accountable for execution
and delivery of the Board-approved strategy.
We also need to continue setting the tone
from the top on the right culture for the Group.
Leading by example is today more important
than ever. Only fully ethical leadership based
on the right values and behaviours can
succeed over the longer term. Anything else

Recognition Awards 2018
The Standard Chartered Recognition
Awards were introduced in 2018 to put
the spotlight on colleagues who bring our
valued behaviours – Do the right thing,
Never settle, Better together – to life,
delivering outstanding outcomes for the
business. The awards reinforce that driving
our performance depends as much on
‘how’ we do things as ‘what’ we do.
The Group Chairman and the Management
Team spent a day with the ﬁnalists, where

is a mirage and bound to evaporate sooner or
later. It is as much about how we do things as
what we do.
Having a strong performance culture should
be closely aligned to the Group’s values. If we
can outperform by making globalisation work
through our diversity of markets and people,
then we have put a solid stake in the ground
about our values throughout all our markets.
At a Board level, our role is to champion this
so that our brand promise, Here for good,
becomes even more of a reality, always and
they learned more about the ﬁnalists’
inspiring stories and experienced their
tremendous enthusiasm ﬁrst-hand.
All the ﬁnalists had showed remarkable
courage, resilience and leadership,
breaking down barriers, and taking
personal responsibility to lead from within,
and not just rely on leadership from above.
Choosing the winners was extremely tough,
but the judges eventually settled on three
outstanding examples of Do the right thing,
Never settle, and Better together, plus one
special Leadership award.

everywhere. It’s the same for conduct – while
progress has been made, it remains a crucial
task of the Board in overseeing that all our
colleagues own our culture and behave
consistently with our valued behaviours.
We recently announced that Carlson Tong
has joined our Board. Carlson has over
30 years’ experience operating in mainland
China, Hong Kong and the wider Asia Paciﬁc
region, and a deep understanding and
knowledge of the ﬁnancial services sector in
some of our key markets. We also announced
that Dr Han Seung-soo is retiring from the
Board. I would like to take this opportunity to
thank Dr Han for his substantial contributions
to the Group over the past nine years, as
well as his considerable insight into Asia,
particularly Korea. Om Bhatt is also stepping
down from the Board, and I would like to
thank Om for his signiﬁcant contribution to the
Group over the past six years, in particular his
insight into banking and India.
Although not part of the formal governance of
the Group, we established our International
Advisory Council, bringing together leading
global ﬁgures, which held its inaugural
meeting in early February. I see this as a
great additional resource for the Group in
helping us better understand the key drivers
inﬂuencing the world and our markets and
their strategic implications for the Group.

Group Chief Executive’s review

Delivering sustainable,
high-quality growth

2018 was a year in which commerce and
prosperity encountered their fair share of
challenges. While the year started strongly
with good momentum across all businesses,
client sentiment in our markets dipped later
in the year, coming under pressure from
geopolitical uncertainties, the rapid escalation
of trade tensions between the US and China,
as well as slower growth in the global
economy. Despite these conditions we
have continued to make good progress
on delivering our key areas of focus.
Our Greater China & North Asia and Retail
Banking businesses overall continue to go
from strength to strength. Our Transaction
Banking business has taken an increasing
share of a competitive market, allowing it to
excel on the back of higher interest rates.
Our Financial Markets business, which is
one of our higher-returning activities and a
major contributor to our network franchise,
has grown in an environment where most
others shrank, and we expect stronger
performance from the refreshed team.

Over half of our income is now generated
from the network and wealth management
activities in which we have invested. This
income is growing quickly and generating
premium returns. This transition to higher
quality growth, together with tight cost and
risk control, means we have improved our
underlying return on tangible equity (RoTE)
a further 120 basis points in 2018 to
5.1 per cent. While we are encouraged by the
steady improvement, we are acutely aware
that this level of return remains below our cost
of capital.
So, what now? The Group, now on secured
foundations and poised for sustainable,
higher-returning growth, is at another
inﬂection point. The refreshed priorities that
we are announcing today will help realise the
value of the franchise, measured not only in
monetary terms but also in the positive
impact on our clients, stakeholders and
communities. We expect to reach a
double-digit RoTE by 2021 by continuing to
build a purpose-led organisation which
propels global trade and investment, helps
our customers and markets achieve wealth
and prosperity, while doing everything that
we can to make the world a cleaner, safer
and more sustainable place.

Financial statements

Standard Chartered is a unique bank.
We have deep roots in, and a non-replicable
network across, many of the world’s most
dynamic markets, where half of the global
GDP growth is expected to be generated
over the next ﬁve years. Every day, our
85,000 employees of 125 nationalities help
millions of people and companies succeed
by growing, investing and protecting their
wealth, while supporting sustainable
economic and social development in the
communities in which we operate. It has
become fashionable to talk about purpose,
but this is not new for us. Throughout our
history, this purpose – to drive commerce
and prosperity through our unique diversity
– has always guided our decisions,
behaviours and everything that we do.

2018 performance

We grew in all segments and regions on a
year-on-year basis, except for Africa & Middle
East, where continued macro-political issues,
exacerbated by currency depreciations,
dampened income momentum.

Risk review and Capital review

Our purpose

Just as it has in the past, our purpose will
continue to enable our success in the future.
It therefore underpins the refreshed priorities
that we are announcing today.

Directors’ report

We have made tremendous progress
since 2015 when we set out to build strong
foundations, get lean and focus on our
strengths, and invest and innovate to delight
our customers. In 2018, we saw further
evidence of this strategy coming through –
we grew proﬁts and returns, reinstated the
interim dividend, improved our customer
satisfaction measures in key products and
segments, invested in exciting transformative
initiatives and became more agile in capturing
attractive opportunities in our markets.

or individual customers who seek help in
managing their wealth.
We continue to improve our services for the
emerging afﬂuent. We launched Premium
Banking in eight markets in 2018. Priority
and Premium customers now make up
56 per cent of our Retail Banking income,
compared to 27 per cent in 2014. This is
no coincidence – we are laser-focused on
improving their banking experience with us,
as exempliﬁed by the fact that the Group is
ranked by RFi Group as the best-in-class
international bank for the Priority segment
in seven of our top eight retail markets.
Our open-architecture wealth management
platform, from which we now generate
30 per cent of our Retail Banking income
compared to 20 per cent in 2014, also
appeals to savers and investors.

We are investing in our digital capabilities
to drive transformation in proﬁtability,
opportunities and ﬁnancial inclusion in the
retail mass market. We are combining
world-class expertise with local knowledge
to be nimble and disruptive. Following the
successful testing and launch of our ﬁrst
digital retail bank in Côte d’Ivoire last year,
we have rolled out a similar model in Uganda,
Tanzania and Ghana, and have plans to roll
out in Kenya in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019,
subject to regulatory approval, and in most of
our African markets by the end of the year.
We have also made over 50 banking services
available on a single mobile app in India. By
collaborating with best-in-class partners, we
can rapidly develop and roll out exceptional
client propositions. Not only have we applied
to establish a virtual challenger bank in
Hong Kong, we, together with Alibaba’s
Ant Financial, have launched two real-time,
cross-border, blockchain-based payment
services for the Hong Kong-Philippines and
Malaysia-Pakistan remittance corridors,
with plans to do more. As we advance our
digital capabilities, we remain committed to
increasing our investments in our cyber
resilience and security. We believe that
easy and immediate access to banking and
wealth advisory services, enabled by mobile
connectivity, will drive wealth and prosperity
in even the most remote corners of our
emerging markets – we have an important
role to play.

Trade and investment
As a global bank with deep local expertise
in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, we
strongly believe in the powerful beneﬁts of
globalisation. For over 160 years, we have
facilitated trade and investment in and across
our markets, contributing to the rapid
economic development of countries from
China to Nigeria, from Singapore to the UAE.
While the beneﬁts of globalisation have not
been equally distributed, as evidenced by the
rising populism in many countries, it cannot
be disputed that global investment and trade
have lifted more than a billion people out of
extreme poverty. Supporting these global
capital ﬂows is at the heart of our business;
not only is it one of our differentiated
customer propositions, but it also enables
us to play a key role in tackling inequality.

08

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Our refreshed strategic priorities include
reinforcing our efforts to support China’s
opening and Africa’s development. As one of
the largest international banks in China, and
the only global bank present in scale across
Africa, we are ideally positioned to help
facilitate cross-border trade and investment
into and out of both regions.
Beyond China and Africa, our presence in
60 markets, including 45 along the Belt &
Road Initiative routes, as well as our wider
network, which serves clients in a further
85 markets, is proving highly attractive to our
clients. Large multinational corporates and
institutions are signing up in increasing
numbers because we can help them
manage their own businesses efﬁciently and
safely across multiple borders. In a report
conducted by East & Partners in 2018, we
ranked ﬁrst for customer satisfaction in trade
ﬁnance across Asia. About two-thirds of
the income generated by our Corporate
& Institutional Banking business is now
from clients that are using the network, a
signiﬁcant increase compared with 2015
when the Group was more focused on
capital-intensive lending to support the
in-country needs of clients.
Our client income is now more diversiﬁed,
less capital-intensive, stickier and higherreturning. But there are still some key markets
where we have not yet fulﬁlled our potential.
We are targeting higher-returning income
and efﬁciencies in India, Korea, the UAE and
Indonesia. Realising the opportunities those
markets present will signiﬁcantly enhance the
Group’s ﬁnancial performance and returns.
As one of the leading trade banks in the
world, we are investing and innovating in
the way global trade ﬁnance operates to
improve our customers’ experiences.
In addition to working with blockchain
platforms like Ripple for real-time crossborder currency settlement and supply
chain ﬁnancing, we are collaborating with
Siemens Financial Services and TradeIX to
create the industry’s ﬁrst blockchain-based
smart guarantees, digitising the end-to-end
process in trade ﬁnance.

¼

Eliminate the drag on our returns from
several low-returning markets, including
India, Korea, the UAE and Indonesia,
through cost and capital actions,
investments in our afﬂuent client franchise
and potentially disruptive partnerships

It is our responsibility to do everything in our
power to make the world cleaner and our
communities more sustainable. In addition
to launching the world’s ﬁrst sovereign blue
bond designed to support sustainable marine
and ﬁsheries projects for the Republic of
Seychelles, we refreshed and consolidated
our Position Statements and announced our
decision not to ﬁnance any new coal-ﬁred
power plants. We are developing ways to
measure and reduce our aggregate carbon
footprint, including those related to our
ﬁnancing activities, and will be working with
our clients and other stakeholders to drive
this commitment around the world. We are
also working with a range of partners to
increase the industry’s understanding of
its role in stopping the illegal wildlife trade.

¼

Streamline our own operations to
ensure we delight our clients, and
drive productivity

¼

Invest in digital initiatives to transform our
business – augmenting strong positions
in more mature markets and disrupting
elsewhere, and collaborating with
best-in-class partners to quickly roll-out
top-class products and services

¼

Rapidly expand sustainable ﬁnancing to
drive a positive social, environmental and
economic impact

We continue to invest in our communities to
promote sustainable economic and social
development. As José mentioned in his
statement, we began to shift our focus in
2018 to delivering community programmes
that promote economic inclusion and
address the challenge of inequality in
our markets.

From turnaround to
transformation
Our refreshed strategic priorities build on our
purpose and earlier areas of focus, but mark
a change in the way we operate as we go
from turnaround to transformation. We are
determined to build a culture of excellence,
grow sustainably, and build long-term returns.
We are doubling-down on what we have
done well, focusing on how we build
partnerships with others to deliver better
outcomes, and reﬁning our approach to
low-returning areas where we can and
must do better. We will:

By doing so, we expect to grow income
between ﬁve and seven per cent, which is
well above the anticipated rate of growth
for the global economy, maintain strong
discipline on costs to generate signiﬁcant
operating leverage and improve our funding
and capital efﬁciency, producing surplus
capital which can be reinvested or returned to
shareholders. It is this combination that we
expect will deliver a RoTE above 10 per cent
by 2021.

Outlook
We remain cautiously optimistic on the
global macroeconomic environment, but
the range of possible outcomes from an
array of matters is wider than it has been
in a long time. This creates uncertainty
among policymakers as well as our clients.
We believe that as multinational companies
grapple with the possibility that barriers to
trade could rise and supply chains may
be impacted, they will ﬁnd it even more
important to deal with banks like ours that
have the sophistication, market presence
and determination to help them navigate
an increasingly complex world.

Supplementary information

We are remediating the Group’s historical
conduct issues and have made substantial
progress in resolving past ﬁnancial crime
control issues. The New York State
Department of Financial Services has
acknowledged the Group’s progress in
remediating and improving its ﬁnancial crime
controls to the point that a monitor is no
longer necessary and has been replaced
by an independent consultant.

¼

Financial statements

It remains our commitment to be a leader
in the ﬁght against ﬁnancial and cyber
crime while partnering with others to do so.
We continue to invest heavily in improving
standards across our markets and with our
clients. In addition to our highly successful
correspondent banking and new NGO
academies, we – along with a group of
global banks – established a joint initiative
to build a digital Trade Information Network,
which will enable better assessment of risks,
particularly around double ﬁnancing and
fraudulent trade information.

Embed a performance-orientated and
innovative culture, which emphasises
conduct and sustainability

Risk review and Capital review

Our unique diversity helps us to be a force
for good. In addition to being included in the
Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the
fourth consecutive year, the Group has been
recognised by Equileap last year as a top
performing UK company for gender equality,
ranking third in the UK and 26th globally – a
signiﬁcant improvement from 42nd in 2017.
However, we still have room to improve.
Although we have virtually no gender pay
gaps in our major markets when adjusted for
level and business area, we continue to have
an overall gender pay gap in the UK and
other major markets, reﬂecting the fact that
we have fewer females than males in senior
roles and in businesses where the market
rates of pay are highest. You may read more
in our 2018 Gender Pay Gap disclosure on
page 46. It will take some time and hard
work, but we will not settle until the gap is
fully closed.

Directors’ report

Since its launch in 2010, our brand promise,
Here for good, has been deeply embedded
into the fabric of our organisation. At its core
is the promise that we will be a force for
good, helping clients navigate complex
threats and manage their ﬁnances consistent
with their own sustainability goals.

We have received a decision notice from the
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) concerning
the Group’s historical ﬁnancial crime controls
and we continue our discussions relating to
the potential resolution of the investigation
by the US authorities relating to historical
violations of US sanctions, the vast majority
of which pre-date 2012. As announced on
20 February 2019, we have made a provision
for potential penalties relating to the US
investigation, the FCA decision and previously
disclosed foreign exchange trading issues.

review

STRATEGIC REPORT

Group Chief Executive’s review continued

Undoubtedly there will be shocks and bumps
along the way, but as we are far more resilient
now, we will be ready to absorb them when
– not if – they come our way, and will seek to
take advantage of disruptions if they occur.

I am proud of our achievements in 2018
and excited for what we have in store for
2019 and beyond. There are always external
factors which are beyond our control, but
they will not be accepted as excuses.
We have what it takes to perform excellently,
and we will plough through obstacles we
ﬁnd in our way to deliver – responsibly and
innovatively – the bank we know we can be.

Conclusion
My colleagues and I have great pride in the
Group and that for which it stands. Adding
a sharper performance edge to that is
essential. In all the markets that I have visited
this year I have delivered one consistent
message to our teams: our business can
only thrive if our customers feel that we are
helping them in extraordinary ways. We are
delivering on that commitment.

Mumbai-headquartered Patel Retail, a manufacturer
and exporter of food and home and personal care items,
signed an INR 100,000,000 ($1.4 million) credit facility
with Standard Chartered in January 2018.
The funds were provided in the form of cash credit and
packing credit and have enabled the ﬁrm to expand its export
business and, as a result, its top line growth. Since taking
the facility Patel Retail has seen its sales revenue increase
by INR 42.5 million ($600,567), or 15 per cent each month.

The company’s Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Deepak Jain, stated
that it chose to work with Standard Chartered over other
banks owing to its unique global footprint.
The company is planning to continue to grow its sales and
export business by 20 per cent per annum over the next ﬁve
years. Patel Retail was established in 2007 in Ambernath,
India. As well as running a manufacturing and export
business for the overseas market, it also owns a chain of

Asia continued to be the main driver of global growth, though
growth also picked up across all other regions

Among the majors, the US was an outperformer, as growth
improved on the back of ﬁscal stimulus

¼

The euro-area economy slowed in 2018, hurt by higher energy
prices, trade disputes and vehicles emission testing that hit car
production and sales

Growth is likely to ease but stay robust in major economies as the
impact of ﬁscal stimulus fades and tighter monetary conditions
begin to have an impact

¼

Major central banks including the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE)
continued their gradual normalisation of monetary policy

A number of factors could slow growth more aggressively:
US-China trade tensions, European politics, China’s tough
economic balancing act, and oil price volatility

¼

These factors could lead to mounting external pressure on
emerging markets with twin deﬁcits, resulting in more aggressive
monetary tightening in these economies

Medium- and long-term view
Ongoing global growth is cyclical in nature
and therefore vulnerable; structural
challenges remain. Productivity growth is
weak, especially in developed countries

¼

Long-term growth in the developed
world is constrained by high levels of
indebtedness and ageing populations

¼

Relatively younger populations in many
emerging markets, the rise of the middle

Rising nationalism, anti-globalisation and
protectionism are a threat to long-term
growth prospects for emerging markets

There is reason to be more optimistic
on long-term growth prospects for

Our strategy

Our strategic priorities
Purpose
and People

Understand our responsibilities
We will increasingly collaborate with
clients and suppliers to improve social
and environmental standards. We
continue to partner with regulators and
other stakeholders to ﬁght ﬁnancial
crime, and aim to make our risk and
control approach a competitive
advantage for us.
Lead sustainable ﬁnancing across
emerging markets
We are maintaining our focus on
supporting sustainable economic
growth, expanding renewables
ﬁnancing and investing in sustainable
infrastructure where it matters most. We
will continue to facilitate the movement
of capital to drive positive social and
economic impact in our markets.
Support the communities where
we live and work
We promote economic inclusion in
our markets through community
programmes aimed at tackling
inequality. We provide disadvantaged
young people with opportunities to learn
new skills, get job-ready and start their
own business. We will continue to
support the visually impaired through
our community programmes.
Maximise return from investment
in our people
We want to deliver a client-centric
environment with an inclusive culture
that capitalises on the experience and
unique diversity of our people. We are
building a future-ready workforce,
embedding digital, agile and people
leadership skills. We aim to amplify the
impact of our people by deploying them
in markets that ﬁt their capabilities and
career aspirations.

Deliver
our
network

Leverage our unique footprint
Our unique network is a long-term
source of growth and sustainably
higher returns. We will continue to
deepen relationships with our clients
to fully realise the revenue potential of
our network.
We are sharpening our client focus to
drive growth momentum and improve
returns. We will place a particular focus
on multinational corporates operating
extensively in Asia, Africa and the Middle
East. We will also increase our focus on
investors and ﬁnancial institutions that
are seeking emerging market solutions.
Build on our strength in China
We will continue connecting our clients
both within and beyond China, with
the aim of doubling our China-related
income contribution as we beneﬁt from
China’s opening. We will increasingly
capture growth opportunities arising
from capital market opening, RMB
internationalisation, Belt & Road
corporate clients, offshore Mainland
Chinese wealth and the Greater
Bay Area.
Grow with Africa
We will continue to grow with our
clients in Africa, focusing on capturing
inbound ﬂows of ﬁnancial institutions,
multinational corporations and Belt &
Road clients. In a number of our markets,
we will look to combine the coverage of
Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking. By rolling out our
cost-efﬁcient digital bank, developed in
Côte d’Ivoire, we aim to double our
Retail Banking clients in Africa in the
medium term.

Grow
our afﬂuent
business

Meet the wealth needs of the
afﬂuent and emerging afﬂuent
By continuously enhancing our offering
for afﬂuent and emerging afﬂuent clients
in markets where we have a Retail
Banking presence, we aspire to be
increasingly relevant for our clients
and drive growth in these segments.
To that end, we are investing in
digitally-delivered wealth propositions
that excite our clients.
Enhance client experience
with data and technology
We will increase our investment in
data and analytics capabilities to
generate a unique understanding of
our clients and their needs, and in
turn improve our offerings, deliver a
personalised experience and increase
client engagement.
Scale the non-afﬂuent segment in
a targeted manner
The rise of the middle class is an
important growth opportunity for our
Retail Banking business across our
footprint. To proﬁtably capture this
opportunity, we will implement new
business models, harness technology
and work with non-bank partners
to acquire and serve non-afﬂuent
clients with our target proﬁle in a
cost-efﬁcient manner.

STRATEGIC REPORT

In particular, we will focus on optimising
the performance of four high potential
markets, namely India, Indonesia,
Korea and the UAE, with targeted action
plans and strong execution discipline.

Focus on Corporate & Institutional
Banking in other markets
In markets where our capabilities are
geared towards international business,
we will reinforce our primary focus
on originating and facilitating crossborder business. In line with this
approach, our Corporate & Institutional
Banking presence will continue to be
expanded with a focus on serving
multinational clients.

Transform our Retail Banking
business with digital
We have made signiﬁcant progress in
digitising our Retail Banking business.
For example, we have rolled out a
full-service, cost-efﬁcient digital bank
in Côte d’Ivoire, and we have applied
for a virtual bank licence in Hong Kong.
Going forward, we aim to adapt and
replicate these capabilities as
appropriate across our footprint to
enhance client experience, improve
efﬁciency, gain market share, disrupt
and build a future-proof retail bank.

Organise around customer
journeys
We are shaping our organisation around
the journeys of our clients, to better align
our processes and way of working with
the needs of our clients and partners.
This will enable us to drive operational
improvements to scale revenue growth
through improved client acquisition,
conversion and retention while also
delivering enhanced efﬁciency. This
will be guided by our principles of
positioning ourselves as a digital
solutions partner, focusing on end-toend digital client experience, transparent
and real time service delivery, and
effective and efﬁcient decision making.

Consolidate strong position with
corporate clients
We have been leading disruptive
innovations in corporate banking.
In 2018 we launched cross-border
remittance services with Ant Financial,
and started the ﬁrst blockchain-based
smart guarantees service in the trade
ﬁnance industry.
We will continue to invest in cutting
edge digital tools and new corporate
banking models, with a particular focus
on blockchain and distributed ledger
technology, platforms and ecosystems,
as well as artiﬁcial intelligence and
machine learning.

Supplementary information

Accelerate growth in our largest
and most proﬁtable markets
In markets where we are a top local
universal bank and have attractive
returns, we will participate in all of our
business segments and invest to grow
our market share.

Continue investing in productivity
Our investment in digitisation will
continue to support productivity
improvements and enhance client
experience, building on the progress
we have made in 2018. For example,
we refreshed our client digital platform
with uniﬁed trade and foreign exchange
capabilities in Corporate & Institutional
Banking. In Retail Banking we launched
real-time client onboarding on digital
channels and refreshed wealth and
foreign exchange platforms with full
mobile access.

Financial statements

Improve returns in markets where
we are an international bank with

GREEN LENDING

Supporting green
lending in the
Middle East
As part of our commitment to sustainable ﬁnance, we’re
creating products and services that enable clients to improve
their own sustainability performance.
In 2018, we acted as green loan coordinator on a transaction
that repriced and extended a $2 billion conventional and
Murabaha (Islamic) revolving credit facility to DP World.
One of our major clients in the Middle East, DP World is
a leading enabler of global trade through its ports and
terminals, maritime services, and industrial parks, logistics
and economic zones.

The transaction team drew on
global expertise from across the
Standard Chartered network to
develop a product that put the client’s
needs at the centre of the process
Recognising DP World’s ambition to be a pioneer in the
region’s capital markets and a leader in sustainability, we
proposed the Middle East’s ﬁrst green loan to link pricing to
the company’s carbon emissions and the ﬁrst with this linkage
in an Islamic format. The loan provides DP World with a
ﬁnancial incentive to improve its environmental performance.
Aligned to our new Sustainability Philosophy, the deal
demonstrates our commitment to ﬁnding innovative ways
to mobilise capital to have a positive environmental and
social impact in our markets.

DIGITAL AND INNOVATION

Our ﬁrst digital-only
bank in Africa

Financial statements

Increased prosperity has made Sub-Saharan Africa’s
population more ﬁnancially savvy, with many looking for new
and easy ways to handle their money. This is why, in March
2018, we launched our ﬁrst digital-only bank in Côte d’Ivoire.

Côte d’Ivoire has led the way in the
adoption of digital ﬁnancial transactions
in West Africa

As part of our offering in Côte d’Ivoire, we have digitised over
70 of the most popular banking services, including account
openings. Customers can open a new account entirely
through our app anytime, anywhere – from the comfort of
their own home or while on the road.

This is a reﬂection of its ongoing economic transformation.
Mobile money account usage stands at 34 per cent of all
adults – among the highest in West Africa – demonstrating
that the population is opting to use mobile money accounts
as opposed to traditional ﬁnancial institutions.

We expect Côte d’Ivoire bank account take-up – led by digital
– to rise rapidly over the next ﬁve years, with the country
poised to act as a digital banking catalyst for the wider region,
just as Kenya sparked East Africa’s mobile money revolution
a decade ago.

Net interest margin
The Group’s net interest margin is calculated
on a statutory basis. Statutory net interest
income grew 7 per cent to $8.8 billion and
the Group’s net interest margin increased
3 basis points to 1.58 per cent. Rises in global
interest rates have beneﬁted asset yields and
interest-earning assets have grown faster
than interest-bearing liabilities. Together this
offset an increase in the rate paid on liabilities
particularly in markets like India and China
where the Group has a higher proportion
of more rate-sensitive customer deposits.

32

Expenses
Operating expenses excluding the UK bank
levy were slightly lower half-on-half and
up 2 per cent year-on-year, generating
3 per cent positive income-to-cost operating
leverage (jaws). Increases were driven by
new investments in people and technology
as well as the amortisation of investments
made in prior years. The Group will continue
to maintain tight control of costs to enable
cash investment at a similar elevated rate
with a growing proportion into technologyenabled initiatives to deliver improvements
in productivity. As a result, it is expected
that expenses between 2019 and 2021
will continue to grow below the rate of
inﬂation with a target to deliver signiﬁcantly
positive jaws.

As interest rates rose there was a greater
propensity among some clients to switch
to higher rate time deposits that, coupled
with competitive pressures on asset yields,
resulted in net interest income growing more
slowly in the second half. This switching
however was not evident in the fourth quarter.

The Group maintains a large proportion of
less rate-sensitive current accounts and
savings deposits that since 2017 have
increased 139 basis points to 32 per cent
of total average liabilities. The Group is
executing a number of operational initiatives
and planned legal entity changes to further
improve the mix of liabilities and expects
to continue to beneﬁt from rises in global
interest rates as monetary policy normalises,
albeit at a reducing rate as the rate-hike
cycle matures.

Credit quality
Continued focus on high-quality origination
within a more granular risk appetite has
enabled sustained improvements in credit
quality in 2018 and resulted in a balance
sheet that is signiﬁcantly more resilient. This is
evidenced by the increase in exposure to
investment grade clients from 57 per cent
to 62 per cent.

IFRS 9 became effective from 1 January
2018 and the Group has not restated
comparative information. Accordingly,
comparisons are made to balances as at

Ongoing business
Gross credit-impaired (stage 3) loans in the
ongoing business of $5.6 billion were
$894 million lower. A lower level of new
inﬂows, particularly in Corporate & Institutional
Banking, as well as debt sales, write-offs and
repayments more than offset higher inﬂows
of Commercial Banking exposures that
had been on early alert for some time.
The cover ratio of stage 3 loans in the
ongoing business remained stable both

before and after collateral, credit grade 12
accounts were broadly unchanged at
$1.4 billion and early alerts were down
$3.9 billion or 45 per cent.
Liquidation portfolio
Gross loans and advances in the liquidation
portfolio were lower by $887 million reﬂecting
further signiﬁcant progress made exiting
these exposures since 2015. The remaining
$1.4 billion gross loans and advances are
93 per cent covered after collateral.
Recognising that the Group has substantially
completed the run-down of this portfolio it
will be reported in underlying performance

Restructuring and other items
The Group’s statutory performance is
adjusted for proﬁts or losses of a capital
nature, amounts consequent to investment
transactions driven by strategic intent, other
infrequent and/or exceptional transactions
that are signiﬁcant or material in the context of
the Group’s normal business earnings for the
period and items which management and
investors would ordinarily identify separately
when assessing performance periodby period.
The Group has made a provision of
$900 million for potential penalties relating
to previously disclosed matters, namely, the
US investigation into historical violation of
sanctions laws and regulations, the decision

notice from the Financial Conduct Authority
concerning the Group’s historical ﬁnancial
crime controls, and investigations related to
foreign exchange trading issues. Further
details of these and other legal and regulatory
matters can be found in Note 26 on
page 305.
Restructuring charges of $478 million
related primarily to Principal Finance and
included a $158 million charge following the
announced agreement to sell the majority of
the business’s related investment portfolio.
The total restructuring charge arising from the
Group’s planned actions announced in 2015
totalled $3.4 billion.

As well as the fourth quarter restructuring
charge related to Principal Finance the Group
has as a result of the refreshed strategic
priorities announced today incurred a
$124 million expense to reduce ongoing
costs and $34 million other impairment
related to the decision to discontinue the
ship leasing business. The Group expects to
incur a further $500 million of restructuring
charges over the next three years in order
to execute the refreshed priorities.
Following the Group’s decision that its joint
venture investment in PT Bank Permata Tbk
is no longer core, proﬁts related to it will in
2019 be reported in restructuring.

Capital base and ratios
The Group’s capital and liquidity positions
are strong with all metrics remaining above
regulatory thresholds. The CET1 ratio of
14.2 per cent was 60 basis points higher
notwithstanding making a signiﬁcant
regulatory provision, driven by lower RWA.

The Group invited holders of a number of
GBP-denominated subordinated and senior
securities to tender their notes for repurchase
by the Group. As a result of this liability
management exercise and other movements,
Tier 2 capital was lower by $1.6 billion.

The Board has recommended a 36 per cent
higher ﬁnal ordinary dividend of 15 cents per
share that, together with the interim dividend
of 6 cents per ordinary share, would result in
a full-year dividend of $694 million compared
with $363 million in 2017 when no interim
dividend was paid.

Summary and outlook
We have made good progress turning
around the Group’s ﬁnancial performance
with proﬁts having increased signiﬁcantly
every year since 2015. We are delivering
returns that are now much closer to the
targets we set out in 2015 and we have
clearly deﬁned the actions required to get
us above a 10 per cent return on tangible
equity by 2021.
We have made a solid start to the year,
although income is down slightly compared
to the equivalent period in 2018 due to
strengthening of the US dollar and buoyant
conditions last year in Wealth Management
and Financial Markets in particular. While
sentiment remains more cautious in the
near-term, robust fundamentals across
our markets mean we remain optimistic
about growth in the medium term.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

This franchise is capable of much more.
The refreshed strategic priorities we have
laid out today that are summarised on
page 17 will reinforce our positions of
strength and differentiation that are driving
proﬁtable growth while also addressing
underperforming businesses and improving
structural efﬁciency. We are investing
signiﬁcantly more than we were in 2015
and an increased proportion is targeted
at technology-enabled productivity
improvements. Our balance sheet is
fundamentally more resilient and the
conduct and culture across the Group
has improved markedly.
We know what our clients want from us,
and what we need to do to become simpler,
faster and more sustainably proﬁtable.

Our actions will improve the client experience
and create a differentiated proposition for
all our stakeholders. We are conﬁdent that
we can generate signiﬁcant returns for
shareholders, including a return on tangible
equity in excess of 10 per cent by 2021.

Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer’s review

Embracing innovation across
the risk landscape
We took positive steps in 2018 to maintain
lower credit impairment and improve asset
quality, helping to further strengthen our
risk position. At the start of the year we
implemented our new Enterprise Risk
Management Framework, identifying ten
Principal Risk Types, including Compliance,
Conduct, Information and Cyber Security and
Financial Crime. This refreshed approach
allows us to view our existing risks more
holistically, while improving our ability to
identify and proactively manage new Risk
Types. As of 1 January 2019, we have
integrated Conduct, Financial Crime and
Compliance risks as a single CFCC function
under the Management Team leadership of
Tracey McDermott. We are also developing
our data and analytics capabilities,
harnessing digital and technological
innovation to enhance the speed and
quality of risk decision-making.
The Group remains well diversiﬁed across
client segments, geographies and industry
sectors, and maintains a strong liquidity and
capital position. We are well positioned to
identify and take new opportunities, while
remaining vigilant for any new threats that
may arise and areas that need improvement.
We take a proactive approach to risk, with
one example being our decision to place
stricter standards on industries that have a

high potential environmental or social impact
in line with the launch of our updated Position
Statements, which set out our approach
to managing environmental, social and
governance risks.

¼

Strengthen the Group’s risk culture
– Embedding a healthy risk culture
continues to be a core objective across
all areas of the Group. It underpins an
enterprise-level ability to identify and
assess, openly discuss, and take prompt
action regarding current and future risks.
Our Enterprise Risk Management
Framework sets out the guiding principles
for our people, enabling us to have
integrated and holistic risk conversations
across all our Principal Risks. We continue
to assess strategic initiatives and growth
opportunities from both the ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial risk perspective, and our
improved approach to effectiveness
reviews facilitates challenge, learning from
self-identiﬁed issues or weaknesses, and
making improvements that are lasting
and sustainable.

¼

Enhance information and cyber
security – Information and cyber security
is an area with an increased risk proﬁle
across ﬁnancial services and other
industries. Along with other organisations,
we continue to invest and increase our
capability in information and cyber security
through the expansion and strengthening
of our operating model. In 2018, we
elevated Information and Cyber Security
Risk to a Principal Risk Type, and a
new framework was approved for
implementation to ensure cyber risks are
identiﬁed and managed in a consistent way
across the Group. In addition, we are
making further improvements through
awareness campaigns, active participation
in external partnerships including the UK
Cyber Defence Alliance, and employment
of an external adviser to provide insights
to the Board on cyber security matters.
These combined efforts help strengthen
our defences and aid our efforts to keep
pace with evolving cyber threats.

¼

Manage ﬁnancial crime risks –
Financial crime hinders economic progress
and harms communities, and we are
committed to ﬁghting it. We have made
substantial progress in building an effective
and sustainable ﬁnancial crime compliance
programme and improving our controls,
systems and processes. Our progress in
this regard was recognised at the end of
2018, when the monitorship ordered by the
New York State Department of Financial
Services was permitted to expire as part of

More information about the Group’s
Sustainability Philosophy can be found at

While we have made great strides in
establishing a healthy risk culture, we
recognise that threats to our business are
constantly evolving, and only by continuing to
explore all available opportunities to improve
can we keep delivering on our brand promise
of being Here for good. In an industry that
faces much disruption, we are committed
to building partnerships and embracing
new technologies to strengthen our
risk capabilities.

An update on our key
risk priorities
2018 was a challenging but productive
year for the Group. Our risk management
approach is at the heart of our business and
is core to us building a sustainable platform
for growth. We want to embed innovation,
digitisation and effective analysis as pillars
of the function. Here is an update on our
key priorities over the past 12 months:

The Group’s portfolios remain strong and
well diversiﬁed. Our continued focus on
high-quality origination within a more granular
Risk Appetite has enabled sustained
improvements in the credit quality of our
corporate portfolios, with the percentage of
net exposure to investment grade clients
increasing to 62 per cent (2017: 57 per cent)
of total corporate net exposure. The Group’s
client exposures also remain predominantly
short tenor. Despite this improvement
we remain alert to broader geopolitical
uncertainties that continue to affect
sentiment. An example is Brexit, although
the Group’s credit portfolio should not be
materially impacted by the UK’s withdrawal
from the European Union.

Gross credit-impaired (stage 3) loans for the
Group are down 21 per cent in the year,
having decreased to $6.9 billion (1 January
2018: $8.8 billion) with a reduction of
$1.0 billion observed in the liquidation
portfolio as we continued to exit these
exposures. Gross stage 3 loans in the
ongoing business decreased to $5.6 billion
(1 January 2018: $6.5 billion); mainly driven
by repayments and write-offs in Corporate &
Institutional Banking. Stage 3/non-performing
loan (NPL) inﬂows in Corporate & Institutional
Banking were also signiﬁcantly lower, as
historically high inﬂows from stressed
portfolios such as India and the Oil and Gas
sectors were muted. Stage 3/NPL inﬂows in
Commercial Banking were higher, driven by
exposures in Greater China & North Asia
and Africa & Middle East, with no speciﬁc
industry concentration.

Our risk proﬁle and performance
in 2018

Credit impairment in the ongoing book
reduced further in 2018 to $740 million
(2017: $1,200 million), driven primarily by
improvements in the Corporate & Institutional
Banking portfolio where there was a
decrease of $428 million (2018: $229 million,
2017: $657 million). This reﬂects an
improvement in the risk proﬁle of the
segment, through a continued focus on
high-quality new origination and recoveries
and releases that were observed across all
segments. Commercial Banking ongoing
business credit impairment increased by
45 per cent (2018: $244 million, 2017:
$168 million) compared to 2017, which saw a
release of $63 million of portfolio impairment
provisions held against certain sectors of the
portfolios that were no longer required. Africa
& Middle East contributed 60 per cent of the
full-year 2018 charge. Retail credit impairment
continued to reduce (2018: $267 million;
2017: $374 million) driven by portfolio
improvements, and run down of high-risk
segments in several unsecured portfolios,
as well as one-off provision releases in Korea
and Indonesia.

Financial statements

Strengthen our conduct environment
– Conduct remains a key focus across
the Group. In 2018, we elevated Conduct
Risk to a Principal Risk Type and made
it a priority to review, reﬁne and further
strengthen our approach to conduct,
ensuring that Conduct Risk is considered
not just in the day to day but in all our
strategic decisions and activities. While the
Group Code of Conduct sets expectations
for individual behaviour, the refreshed
Conduct Risk Type Framework provides a
more robust and consistent approach to
allow us to assess and monitor Conduct
risk across the Group’s businesses and
functions. A key priority in 2019 will be to
embed Conduct Risk considerations into
the other non-ﬁnancial risks, to ensure
that we make the right holistic decisions.
While incidents cannot be entirely avoided
across the Group, we have no appetite
for breaches of laws or regulations, and
we expect nothing less than the highest
standards at all levels.

Improve our efﬁciency and
effectiveness – The Group has
continued to invest in improvements
to infrastructure, including exposure
management, data quality and stress
testing. Further enhancements are planned
for Operational Risk management,
workﬂow and reporting. We are working
with ﬁntech partners and innovating
internally to explore new opportunities
with machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence
and data analytics infrastructure. We
continue to streamline and simplify our
processes to serve clients better and
drive internal efﬁciencies.

Our subsidiary in Germany is established
and we are focused on managing the
operational and regulatory risks that will arise
as a result of Brexit. We continue to focus on
early identiﬁcation of emerging risks across
all our portfolios so that we can proactively
manage any areas of weakness. We also
perform regular reviews and stress tests of
our portfolio to help mitigate any risks that
might arise. Our risk management capability
has also improved through investment in
credit structuring and distribution resources.

Enhance our compliance
infrastructure – In 2018, we established
a multi-year programme to review and
strengthen our existing structures and
processes, and we have already delivered
tangible progress in several areas. We
implemented a new Regulatory Obligations
Management system, and in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2019 we will install a refreshed
system for Issue Management and Policy
and Document Management. We rolled
out an enhanced learning programme for
our compliance ofﬁcers, as well as a
progressive development path. In the
second half of 2018, we launched a shared
service centre for surveillance in Kuala
Lumpur, equipped with staff providing a
broad range of capabilities across Trade
and Communications Surveillance. We
also implemented a knowledge-sharing
tool that explains important trends in the
world of technology and highlights the key
compliance issues that may arise as a
result. These improvements help our
people to make better informed and
consistent decisions and raise our ability to
innovate in response to the ever-changing
regulatory landscape.

ﬁnancial industry can combat illegal wildlife
trafﬁcking. Initiatives like this are in line with
our Sustainability Philosophy and target
those at the heart of ﬁnancial crime from
multiple angles. By cutting off their sources
of funds, we can help to make the ﬁnancial
system a hostile environment for criminals,
while supporting economic development
across all of our markets.

The stage 3 cover ratio in the total book
has reduced marginally to 59 per cent in
2018 (1 January 2018: 60 per cent), largely
driven by the impact of write-offs and

STRATEGIC REPORT

Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer’s
review

The Group maintains a strong liquidity
position, with the liquidity coverage ratio
higher at 154 per cent from 146 per cent in
2017, driven by an increase in our liquid asset
position partially aligned to the growth in our
overall balance sheet as we continued to
focus on high-quality liquidity across our
businesses. The advances-to-deposits ratio
(2018: 64.9 per cent) decreased from the
previous year (2017: 67.0 per cent). We remain
a net provider of liquidity to the interbank
markets and our customer deposit base is
diversiﬁed by type and maturity. We have a
substantial portfolio of marketable securities
which can be realised in the event of a
liquidity stress situation.
The Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of
14.2 per cent was 60 basis points higher
than 2017 mainly due to a lower level of
risk-weighted assets, which reduced by
$21.5 billion. This was driven by a reduction
in credit risk-weighted assets of $15.1 billion.
The average level of total trading and
non-trading VaR in 2018 was 20 per cent
lower than in 2017 because of a reduction in
the duration of the non-trading portfolio in the
ﬁrst half of 2018. However, by year end 2018
the non-trading VaR increased, driven by an
increase in the portfolio inventory and reduced
portfolio diversiﬁcation in the second half of
the year.
Further details of the 2018 risk performance are set
out in the Risk update (pages 138 and 139) and the
Risk proﬁle section (pages 140 to 192)

An update to our risk
management approach
In 2018, we made good progress in
delivering the key initiatives started in 2017
to implement a strong risk management
approach. We have continued to build out
the Enterprise Risk Management function
which allows the Group to identify and
manage risks holistically, ensuring that
appropriate governance, oversight and
information is in place to run a safe, secure
and well-controlled organisation. It also
strengthens the Group’s capabilities to
understand, articulate and control the
nature and level of risks we take while still
serving our clients effectively.
The Enterprise Risk Management
Framework, launched in 2018, sets out a
refreshed risk culture and a clear control
framework with sharper delineation of
responsibilities between the three lines of
defence. Further details on the Group’s
Three Lines of Defence model are set
out in the Enterprise Risk Management
Framework section (page 193). We have also
formalised the links between our strategy,
Risk Appetite and stress testing to facilitate
more dynamic risk identiﬁcation and the
integration of risk considerations into
strategic decision-making.
We have developed distinct Risk Type
Frameworks for our 10 Principal Risks
which are being rolled out throughout the
organisation. Principal Risk Types are
risks that are inherent in our strategy and
business model and have been formally
deﬁned in the Group’s Enterprise Risk
Management Framework.

Through the development and approval of
these Risk Type Frameworks, we have
revised the deﬁnition of certain Principal
Risk Types to describe the risks or failures
more explicitly.
We have also established an Effectiveness
Review process for the Enterprise Risk
Management Framework and Risk Type
Frameworks which provides an objective
baseline against which progress can be
measured over the coming years.
The 2018 Effectiveness Review concluded
that the Enterprise Risk Management
Framework has been effectively designed
towards improving the Group’s risk
management practices.
Over the course of 2019, the Group aims
to further strengthen its risk management
practices. More details can be found in the
Enterprise Risk Management Framework
section (pages 193 to 197).
The framework provides a structure for the
monitoring and control of these risks through
the Board-approved risk appetite. The Group
will not compromise adherence to its risk
appetite in order to pursue revenue growth
or higher returns. The table below shows the
Group’s Principal Risk Types and how they
are managed.
Further details on Principal Risks are set out in the
Risk management approach (pages 193 to 217)

Principal Risk Types

How these are managed

Credit Risk

The Group manages its credit exposures following the principle of diversiﬁcation across products, geographies, client
segments and industry sectors

Country Risk

The Group manages its country cross-border exposures following the principle of diversiﬁcation across geographies and
controls business activities in line with the level of jurisdiction risk

Traded Risk

The Group controls its trading portfolio and activities to ensure that traded risk losses (ﬁnancial or reputational) do not
cause material damage to the Group’s franchise

Capital and Liquidity Risk The Group maintains a strong capital position, including the maintenance of management buffers sufﬁcient to support its
strategic aims, and holds an adequate buffer of high-quality liquid assets to survive extreme but plausible liquidity stress
scenarios for at least 60 days without recourse to extraordinary central bank support
Operational Risk

The Group controls operational risks to ensure that operational losses (ﬁnancial or reputational), including any related to
conduct of business matters, do not cause material damage to the Group’s franchise

Reputational Risk

The Group protects the franchise from material damage to its reputation by ensuring that any business activity is
satisfactorily assessed and managed by the appropriate level of management and governance oversight

Compliance Risk

The Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations, while recognising that while regulatory non-compliance
cannot be entirely avoided, the Group strives to reduce this to an absolute minimum

Conduct Risk

The Group strives to maintain the standards in our Code of Conduct and outcomes of our Conduct Framework, by
continuously demonstrating that we Do The Right Thing in the way we do business

Information and
Cyber Security Risk

The Group seeks to avoid risk and uncertainty for our critical information assets and systems and has a low appetite for
material incidents affecting these or the wider operations and reputation of the bank

Financial Crime Risk

The Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to ﬁnancial crime, recognising that while incidents
are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided

Our stakeholders
We believe that regular and
constructive dialogue with
stakeholders is central to
delivering sustainable and
responsible banking.

If we are to drive commerce and prosperity,
we need to understand the long-term issues
that impact our markets. During 2018, we
increased engagement with stakeholders
and continued to listen and respond to
the environmental, social and corporate
governance (ESG) concerns of a wide
range of external groups.

Stakeholder feedback is communicated
internally to senior management through the
relevant forums and governing committees.
It helps inform our response to these issues
and maintain good relationships in the
markets where we operate.
Progress is communicated regularly through
channels such as sc.com and this report.

We track both short- and long-term issues,
assessing them based on business impact
and level of stakeholder concern.

How we serve and engage

How we serve and engage

We enable individuals to grow and protect their
wealth. We help businesses to trade, transact,
invest and expand. We also help a variety of
ﬁnancial institutions, including banks, public
sector and development organisations, with
their banking needs.

We engage with relevant authorities to play our
part in supporting the effective functioning of the
ﬁnancial system and the broader economy.

Clients are at the heart of everything we do as a bank. By building
and fostering long-term relationships with our clients, we can serve
them better, deepen our relationships, uphold our reputation and
attract new customers to grow our business. In recent years,
we have seen increasing demand from our clients for sustainable
ﬁnance products.
Delivering fair outcomes for clients is a priority, starting with
products and services that are well-designed, fairly and reasonably
priced, and supported by clear and concise information. Client
interests are factored into our business strategies, including
how we set and monitor revenue targets, govern new product
development, review and assess existing products and
discontinue products. We aim to deal with issues in a fast, fair
and efﬁcient way and each business segment has tailored
procedures and processes in place to handle client complaints.
Good business conduct remains central in all our client
interactions. Across our businesses, we aim to ensure that frontline
colleagues are trained and certiﬁed, provide the right information
about fees, risks and product features and deliver on service level
promises. In Corporate & Institutional Banking, colleagues must
identify and manage possible conﬂicts of interests with clients in
an open, honest and clear way, and carry out all client orders in
a way that treats all clients fairly.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

In 2018, we engaged with policymakers at all levels to exchange
information on topics such as prudential rules, Brexit, supporting
trade and economic growth, climate change, ﬁntech, artiﬁcial
intelligence, cyber security and ﬁghting ﬁnancial crime.
We are committed to complying with legislation, rules and other
regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses and operations
in the jurisdictions within which we operate. Our compliance with
legal and regulatory frameworks across our markets ensures that
the Group meets its obligations. In turn, this supports the resilience
and effective functioning of the Group and the broader ﬁnancial
system and economy. In 2018, we brought our Public Affairs and
Group Regulatory Reform teams together to form a new Public
and Regulatory Affairs team responsible for anticipating changes
to relevant legislation and regulation. This helps ensure we comply
with requirements and manage relationships with regulators and
governments effectively.
We actively engage with governments, regulators and policymakers
at a global, regional and national level to share insights and technical
expertise on key policy issues. This engagement supports the
development of best practice and the adoption of consistent
approaches across our markets. We comply with all relevant
transparency requirements and engage with governments and
regulators in many ways, including through ongoing dialogue,
submission of responses to formal consultations and by participating
in industry working groups. We typically publish our consultation
responses on regulations that impact the Group on sc.com.
In 2019, we expect to focus engagement activities on regulation and
legislation associated with emerging technologies and innovations
in banking. We will also continue to engage on Brexit, global trade
developments, the Belt and Road initiative and climate change.

How we serve and engage

We aim to deliver robust returns and long-term
sustainable value for our investors.

We work with local and global suppliers to ensure
they can provide the right goods and services for
our business, efﬁciently and sustainably.

Our operating footprint, along with a commitment to sustainable
and responsible banking, uniquely connects investors in
established capital markets with opportunities in emerging
markets. In this context, we believe that an integrated approach
to ESG issues and a strong risk and compliance culture provide
a competitive advantage.

During 2018, we engaged with investors in a number of ways
including at conferences and on roadshows. In May, we hosted
a seminar on our second largest business, Retail Banking, in
London. Increasingly, investors are engaging us on ESG matters
including the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals,
climate change, coal and human rights. Following our commitment
at the AGM, we hosted several bilateral engagements covering our
Sustainability Philosophy, updated Position Statements and our
Prohibited Activities list. These and other topics were covered at
the Chairman’s stewardship and strategy forum in September.

In 2019, we will continue to engage with investors on how we will
sustainably improve our returns to create value over the long term.
For more information about Board engagement with shareholders in 2018,
see page 70 in the corporate governance section of the Directors’ report

We are committed to embedding sustainability in our procurement
practices and in 2019, we will deﬁne targets to encourage greater
diversity in our supply chain. This includes supporting sourcing
from businesses owned by women, and micro and small
businesses. Our new supply chain management system,
SCBuy will provide improved data on sustainability issues such
as modern slavery and diversity and inclusion. The ﬁrst phase of
SCBuy was implemented in 2018. It will be completed in 2021.
Download our Supplier Charter
at sc.com/suppliercharter

Supplementary information

We engage with sustainability analysts and participate in
sustainability indices that provide independent benchmarking of
our performance. We are included in FTSE4Good and submit to
the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

We engage globally and locally to create value through the supply
chain for both our business and our vendors. Our strategic supplier
relationship management programme helps build relationships
with our 36 key suppliers. In 2018, we held engagement sessions
in Hong Kong and the UK to strengthen collaboration and
innovation with strategic suppliers. Small and medium-sized
business owners are given the opportunity to participate in our
sourcing activities and local supply teams engage them within our
markets to help them meet the standards set out in our Supplier
Charter. We also work with small and medium-sized ﬁntechs with
SC Ventures to drive greater innovation in our supply chain.

Financial statements

Using the capital that we receive from equity and debt investors,
we execute our business model with a focus on delivering
sustainable value for all shareholders. Whether they have
a short- or long-term investment horizon, we provide all
investors with information about all aspects of our ﬁnancial
and sustainability performance.

Engagement with suppliers is guided by our Supplier Charter,
which sets out what we expect of vendors on issues such as
ethics, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, human rights and
environmental performance. Suppliers must recommit to the
charter annually, and regular engagement to monitor performance
is built into our procurement practices and standards. In 2018,
we hosted vendor forums across a number of our markets
where we discussed the Bank’s valued behaviours and
conduct expectations.

How we serve and engage

We believe that great client
experience is driven by great
colleague experience. We want
our people to pursue their
ambitions, to deliver with purpose,
and have a rewarding career
enabled by great people leaders.
Purpose-led cultural change
Our culture is the foundation for delivering
on our purpose to drive commerce and
prosperity through our unique diversity.
We continue to embed our culture through
our valued behaviours (Never Settle, Do the
Right Thing and Better Together), which
describe a culture that balances innovation,
client focus, ethics and inclusion. We have
integrated these refreshed valued behaviours
into the way we hire, recognise, reward and
develop our people.

Engaging our colleagues
More than 73,000 (90 per cent) of our people
took part in our annual engagement survey.
When asked ‘How does working for the Bank
make you feel?’, emotions such as pride,

happiness and optimism ranked highly, while
colleagues expressed some frustration with
work processes. Engagement levels are at
67 per cent (in-line with 2017 results, and up
from 2016) with 96 per cent of respondents
committed to doing what is required to
help us succeed. Follow-up actions include
simplifying company processes, promoting
innovative practices and encouraging
colleagues to identify small changes in
our work processes that can make a
big difference.
The Board hosts engagement sessions with
colleagues when travelling to our markets
and we are also introducing new ways
for colleagues and the Board to interact,
for example, through online discussions.
This aligns with the new UK Corporate
Governance Code requirements on
workforce engagement.
We proactively manage risks associated with
our workforce (such as engagement, attrition,
development and conduct) through our risk
management frameworks. Additionally, we
continue to review our people agenda in light
of the changing needs of the future workforce
so that we can remain an employer of choice
for the talent upon which we depend.

Our commitment to wellbeing
We are committed to bringing out the best in
colleagues by establishing and maintaining
a work environment that promotes positive
wellbeing and healthy lifestyle choices.
Our vision is to create a culture where
employees have access to a range of
wellbeing resources to help them remain
happy and healthy, and can seek help
when they need it. We recognise that every
employee has different needs and our four
wellbeing pillars – mental, physical, social
and ﬁnancial – allow us to provide support
to employees at every stage of their lives.

Developing our colleagues
Developing our people and ﬁnding the
right opportunities for them to succeed is
a priority for us. In 2018, we identiﬁed and
brought together two global talent pools
for emerging and high potential talent. These
are groups of talented leaders at different
stages in their career who have the potential
to operate in more senior and complex
leadership roles in the future. The pools are
designed to prepare and accelerate their
readiness for succession to Management
Team roles over the short, medium and
long-term.

Gender equality
Our goal is to engage and support all
genders, and progress towards gender
equality. In April this year, our Group CEO
signed a statement of support for the United
Nations Women Empowerment Principles.
These seven principles underpin our
commitment to support women in the
workplace, marketplace and community.
We have seen a positive trend in female
representation in our senior leadership roles,

increasing from 25.7 per cent in 2017 to
27.7 per cent at the end of 2018. We are
proud of the progress that we have made,
but recognise there is more work to do.
We understand that gender equality can
only be reached by a focus on all genders.
Our Group Flexible Working Policy, Shared
Parental Leave Policy, Fair Pay Charter,
mentoring and leadership programmes
continue to support all our colleagues.
We also recognise both International
Women’s and Men’s Day to enable a
constructive dialogue, improve gender
relations, break traditional gender norms,
highlight role models and minimise bias
and stereotypes.
In 2018, we were recognised by Equileap in
the gender equality global report as a top
performing UK company for gender equality.
The Bank has been ranked 26th on the
global ranking (up from 42nd in 2017) and
3rd in the UK ranking where we did not rank
at all in 2017. We were also proud to have
ﬁve colleagues recognised by the Financial
Times & HERoes Champions of Women in
Business 2018 who haven’t just achieved
success themselves, but also committed to
lifting others as they climb, and ultimately
fuelling the female talent pipeline. For the third

development. The workshop builds
understanding of how to create an
inclusive culture, how biases can affect
our decision-making processes and
how to unlock the power of our teams.
We plan on reaching over 75 per cent
of our people leaders by the end
of 2019.

The mean bonus pay gap has decreased
from 57 per cent in 2017 to 49 per cent in

that short-term, year-on-year comparison is
of limited use, as there will be changes to the
population and in the distribution of bonus
payments relating to Group, business area
and individual performance.
We are committed to increasing the number
of women in senior roles and have initiatives
in place to support this; we acknowledge
it will take time to see the level of change
needed to reduce the gender pay gap.
When adjusting the hourly pay gap for men
and women carrying out roles at the same
level in the same business area for the
UK and four of our markets, there is no
discernible pay gap.
Equal pay is a more detailed measure of
pay equality and a key commitment in our
Fair Pay Charter. We analyse equal pay
during our annual performance and pay
review process globally to assure ourselves
that we deliver equal pay for equal work.

We have analysed our gender pay gap for
the UK and for four of our major markets.
The gender pay gap compares the average
pay of men and women, without accounting
for some of the key factors which inﬂuence
pay, including different roles, skills, seniority
and market pay rates. Our gender pay gap
is caused by the lower number of women
in senior roles and in business areas where
market rates of pay are highest.

The mean hourly pay gap in the UK has
increased from 30 per cent in 2017 to
32 per cent in 2018. While an increase
in the gap appears incongruous with
making progress on gender equality, we
acknowledge that the actions we are taking
to close the gap will take time and that in the
short-term, small changes in the population
will continue to have an impact.

SOCIETY

We strive to operate as a
sustainable and responsible
business, collaborating with
local partners to promote social
and economic development.

Sustainable and responsible
business
Our goal is to promote economic and social
development in a sustainable way, in line with
our purpose and valued behaviours. We do
this by integrating sustainability throughout
our business, operations and community
programmes.

Our ambition is to increase our support
and funding for sustainable ﬁnancing and
in 2018, following extensive engagement
with investors and clients, we set up a
dedicated team to maximise opportunities
for sustainable ﬁnance in our markets.

Good progress continues to be made
against our 11 Sustainability Aspirations,
which were created in 2016 in alignment with
the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals. They set out measurable targets to
deliver sustainable outcomes in areas such
as infrastructure and clean technology.
Detailed progress against the Aspirations
can be found in our separate Sustainability
Summary.

Group KPI:
Sustainability
Supplementary information

By delivering against our three sustainability
pillars and 11 Sustainability Aspirations,
we can achieve our purpose and be Here
for good.

A new Bank-wide Sustainability Forum,
nominated by the Management Team and
led by the Group Head, Corporate Affairs,
Brand & Marketing, Conduct, Financial Crime
and Compliance, was set up to develop and
deliver the Bank’s sustainability strategy. The
forum is supported by a new Sustainable
Finance Working Group and strengthened
working groups on human rights and climate
change. The forum will report regularly to the
Management Team and the Brand, Values
and Conduct Committee of the Board.

In 2019, the team will focus on creating a
Bank-wide sustainable ﬁnance strategy,
further incorporating sustainability into the
Bank’s ﬁnancing decisions and identifying
new sustainable ﬁnance opportunities
for clients.

Financial statements

Here
for good

For the ﬁrst time, we set out how we
balance economic, environmental and social
needs in our decision-making through our
Sustainability Philosophy and publicly shared
the list of Prohibited Activities that the Bank
will not ﬁnance. The list includes restrictions
involving child and forced labour, trade in
endangered wildlife, and Arctic and tar sands
exploration and production. The full list can
be found at sc.com/prohibitedactivities.

The Sustainable Finance team brings
together our business expertise with our
capabilities in environmental and social
risk management. Its role is to identify
opportunities to develop new ﬁnancial
products and services that have a positive
social and economic impact while also
ensuring that environmental, social and
governance considerations are incorporated
into banking decisions.

Risk review and Capital review

In 2018, we laid the foundations for
an ambitious transformation of our
sustainability performance. We clariﬁed our
sustainability philosophy and positions on
key sustainability issues, introduced new
governance frameworks to further integrate
sustainability across the Bank and
reorganised business teams to increase
our focus on sustainable ﬁnance.

SOCIETY CONTINUED

We regularly measure the social and
economic impact of the Bank’s activities in
our markets and in 2018, we focused on
our impact in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
Using 2016 data, our report into Standard
Chartered’s socio-economic impact in East
Africa determined that the Bank provided
$3.4 billion of ﬁnancing, direct and indirect
value-added impacts of $2.8 billion, and
direct and indirect employment to more
than one million people.

Contributing to sustainable
economic growth
We ﬁnance key sectors and create products
and services that drive sustainable economic
growth while managing environmental and
social risks associated with our ﬁnancing.
Managing environmental and social risks
Our most signiﬁcant environmental and social
impacts come from the business we ﬁnance.
Following a comprehensive review, in 2018
we released our revised cross-sector
environmental and social risk framework and
updated Position Statements, which have
been consolidated across ﬁve sectors and
two themes. These draw on International
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance
Standards, the Equator Principles and global
best practice, setting out the conditions
under which we will support the activities
of clients operating in sectors with a high
potential environmental or social impact.
The review resulted in a revised position on
power generation and a decision to end
ﬁnancing for new coal-ﬁred power plants,
save where we have an existing commitment.
We identify and assess environmental and
social risks related to our Corporate &
Institutional, Commercial and Business
Banking clients, and embed our
environmental and social risk framework
directly into our credit approval process.
All relationship managers and credit
ofﬁcers are offered training in assessing
environmental and social risk against our
criteria, as well as access to online resources.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

In 2018, we reviewed 827 transactions that
presented potential speciﬁc risks against our
Position Statements. Where possible, we
work collaboratively with clients to mitigate
all identiﬁed risks. Where this is not possible,
transactions have been, and will continue to
be, turned down.

Being a responsible company
We strive to manage our business sustainably
and responsibly, drawing on our purpose,
brand promise, valued behaviours and Code
of Conduct to enable us to make the right
decisions.

During 2019, we will build on this momentum
embedding the Position Statements through
e-learning and classroom-based training for
frontline and risk colleagues and extending
transaction reviews to the Private Bank.
As a member of the Equator Principles (EP)
Steering Committee, we will also play an
active part in the review of EP4 during 2019.

Promoting good conduct
Recognising its importance, we identiﬁed
conduct as a Principal Risk Type in 2018
and clariﬁed how we deﬁne Conduct Risk,
re-emphasising our focus on ensuring fair
client outcomes. We updated the framework
and policy that embed the practices that help
us identify, aggregate and measure conductrelated risks.

Assessing climate change
During 2018, we advanced our approach to
climate change and concluded work with
the University of Oxford to assess the impact
of climate change on energy utilities clients.
We collaborated with 15 banks and the UN
Environment Programme to pilot scenario
analysis for physical and transition risks in key
sectors. This provided preliminary information
on climate impacts and will help us as we
develop further climate analytics.

Our Code of Conduct remains the central
tool through which we set out our conduct
expectations. Our goal is to create the right
environment to support ethical behaviour so
all employees know, understand and play
their part. Leaders are encouraged to recruit
and recognise colleagues based on good
conduct, while performance objectives and
reward mechanisms are directly linked to the
our valued behaviours.

We published our ﬁrst report aligning to
the recommendations of the Taskforce on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
and announced our intention to develop a
methodology to measure, manage and
ultimately reduce the emissions related
to our activities and those related to the
ﬁnancing of our clients. We will progress
this in 2019 alongside work with the
Banking Environment Initiative Bank 2030
project to identify climate opportunities.

Conduct training is obligatory and colleagues
are asked annually to recommit to the
Code of Conduct. In 2018, 99.6 per cent
reconﬁrmed their commitment to the code.
Failure to adhere to the code can result in
disciplinary action and potentially dismissal.
Our focus in 2019 is to embed the
requirements of the new framework
across businesses and functions.

Serious about
carbon reduction
We have measured our energy use
and greenhouse gas emissions since
2008. In 2018, we set ambitious new
Science Based Targets to signiﬁcantly
reduce our carbon footprint over three
time horizons from a 2017 baseline
of 187,936 tonnes: 36 per cent to
121,000 tonnes by 2025; 55 per cent
to 84,000 tonnes by 2030; and
90 per cent to 18,000 tonnes by 2050.
Recognising the need for industrywide solutions to climate change,
we also joined the Science Based
Targets Expert Advisory Group.
Meeting these challenging targets
will require efﬁciency improvements
across our properties, including a
review of fuel usage and a further
increase in renewable energy sources.

Supplementary information

We are committed to providing a safe
environment for colleagues to report
concerns. Trust and conﬁdence in the
Speaking Up programme has grown. This is
evidenced by an increase in the number of
concerns being raised. It is supported by
the results from our My Voice employee
survey, in which 91 per cent of colleagues
responded favourably to the statement:
‘I feel comfortable to Speak Up if I see a
violation of the Bank’s policies, valued
behaviours and Code of Conduct’.

In 2018, we strengthened several of the key
tools and platforms that support our FCC
activities and contributed to reducing ﬁnancial
crime across the sector through publicprivate information sharing partnerships in
the UK, the US, Singapore and Hong Kong.
We are a member of the United for Wildlife
Financial Taskforce, which has been formed
to create and deliver actionable intelligence to
combat the illegal wildlife trade.

Our Position Statement on human rights
outlines our approach, reﬂecting the
International Bill of Human Rights, the
UN Guiding Principles and the UK Modern
Slavery Act. This is then embedded
across a range of internal policies and
risk management frameworks, including
our Group Code of Conduct and
Supplier Charter.

Financial statements

In 2018, 608 cases were closed following
investigation (these included cases raised in
2018 as well as cases raised in prior years).
The concerns raised were substantiated in
318 of those cases while 290 were found
to be unsubstantiated. A range of actions
have been taken in response to these cases
including improvements to processes or
controls, additional training and, in the
most serious cases, disciplinary action
and dismissals.

We maintain sound defences against money
laundering, terrorist ﬁnancing, sanctions
compliance breaches, bribery and other
forms of corruption. A dedicated Financial
Crime Compliance (FCC) team leads our
risk management activities, which include
adhering to anti-money laundering and
sanctions policies, and applying core controls
such as client due-diligence screening and
monitoring. Anti-bribery and corruption
(ABC) policies aim to prevent colleagues,
or third parties working on our behalf,
from participating in active or passive
bribery or corruption, or from making
facilitation payments.

Respecting human rights
We are committed to respecting human
rights and seek to ensure they are not
adversely impacted in our role as an
employer, ﬁnancial services provider
and procurer of goods and services.
We recognise that our footprint and
supply chain give us the opportunity to
raise awareness of human rights and
modern slavery in a wide range of markets
and industries.

Risk review and Capital review

Speaking Up
Speaking Up is our conﬁdential and
anonymous whistleblowing programme.
It includes independent and secure channels
for anyone – colleagues, contractors,
suppliers and members of the public –
to raise concerns.

Fighting fnancial crime
Our aim is partnering to lead in the ﬁght
against ﬁnancial crime, protecting our
business, clients and wider communities
from its damaging effects. By cutting off
their sources of funds, we can help make
the ﬁnancial system a hostile environment
for criminals, while supporting economic
development across all our markets.

SOCIETY CONTINUED

In 2018, we continued to review and enhance
our controls relating to modern slavery.
Our 2018 Modern Slavery Statement
details the actions we are taking as a result.
These include reviewing how we approach
allegations of modern slavery in our business
relationships. We evolved our Modern Slavery
Working Group into a wider Human Rights
Working Group to support progress across
the Group.
Read our 2018 Modern Slavery Statement at
sc.com/modernslavery

Managing our environmental footprint
We aim to reduce the direct environmental
impact of our operations, namely our
branches and ofﬁces, which use paper, water
and energy, and generate greenhouse gas
emissions and produce non-hazardous
waste. We do not produce material quantities
of hazardous waste, and therefore do not
measure or report on the production or
handling of hazardous waste.
In 2008, we set long-term targets to reduce
energy and water use by 2019. This year, we
achieved our energy target for properties in
temperate climates one year early. Overall, we
reduced energy consumption by 45 per cent
between 2008 and 2018 through measures
including LED lighting, effective space
management and more efﬁcient use of fans,
chillers and boilers.

Essentials for girls’
empowerment
In 2018, we co-authored a report with
Dalberg Advisors that identiﬁed the eight
essential elements for girls’ economic
empowerment. Released on International
Women’s Day, the report illustrates how
elements such as freedom of movement,
freedom from violence, and access to
education, healthcare and contraception,
must be met for girls to fulﬁl their
economic potential. To succeed, girls
need: more support to become
employable; more men, boys and older
women to champion them; more goods
and services made for them; and more
role models and support networks, such
as those provided by Goal, our girls’
empowerment programme.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

We are committed to managing water
responsibly and reduced water use by
57 per cent between 2008 and 2018.
We achieved this through a range of initiatives
including ultra-low ﬂow water devices.
Although we have made good progress,
we are currently not on track to achieve our
target of 72 per cent reduction by 2019.
Recognising that achieving the last part
of the target will be the most challenging,
we are working across our properties to
ﬁnd innovative ways to achieve the target.
We did not have any issues sourcing water
that is ﬁt for purpose in 2018.
We aim to minimise waste and continued
to reduce plastic use by introducing
bio-degradable containers and cutlery into
our on-site restaurants. We also extended
our re-useable cup initiative to other
geographies including the US and the UAE.
It has saved more than 500,000 single-use
cups since 2017. Rather than send nonrecyclable waste to landﬁll, we aim to
compost it or use it in energy generation.
In total, these measures resulted in
46 per cent of waste being recycled or
reused in 2018 – up from 24 per cent in 2017.

for SiB between 2003 and 2018. We will
deliver SiB projects until the end of 2020 and
will continue to support visually impaired

We continue to identify ways to improve our
environmental performance. In 2019, we will
review the methodology used to measure our
energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The directors are required to issue a viability
statement regarding the Group, explaining
their assessment of the prospects of the
Group over an appropriate period of time
and state whether they have reasonable
expectation that the Group will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities
as they fall due.

In considering the viability of the Group, the
directors have assessed the key factors likely
to affect the Group’s business model and
strategic plan, future performance, solvency
and liquidity taking into account the principal
uncertainties as well as the principal risks.

To assess the Group’s balance sheet
vulnerabilities and capital and liquidity
adequacy, severe but plausible
macroﬁnancial scenarios explore
shocks that trigger one or more of:
¼

Global slowdowns, including a China
hard landing

Financial market turbulence

Under this range of scenarios, the results
of these stress tests demonstrate that the
Group has sufﬁcient capital and liquidity to
continue as a going concern and meet
regulatory minimum capital and liquidity
requirements.
To assess the Group’s business model
vulnerabilities, extreme and unlikely scenarios
are explored that, by design, result in the
Group’s business model no longer being
viable. Insights from these reverse stress
tests can inform strategy, risk management
and capital and liquidity planning.
Further information on stress testing is provided
in the Risk management approach section
(page 209)

The Board Risk Committee exercises
oversight of prudential risks on behalf of
the Board, including among others credit,
market, capital, liquidity and funding and
operational risks.
It reviews the Group’s overall risk appetite
and makes recommendations thereon to
the Board.
The Board Risk Committee receives
regular reports that inform them of the
Group’s key risks, as well as updates on the
macroeconomic environment, geopolitical
outlook, market developments, and
regulatory updates in relation to capital,
liquidity and risk. In 2018, the Committee
had deeper discussions on a number of key
topics including Korea – Geopolitical Risks,
the Group’s Commercial Real Estate Risk
Strategy and Portfolio, increase in Turkish
interest rates, Commodities, Credit and
Portfolio Management, Commercial Banking
Loan Impairments and Downgrades in
2017 and 2018, information and cyber
security, the use of Cloud, Sensitivity to a
strengthening US dollar, Concentration Risk
across Africa in relation to Rising Sovereign
Debt Levels, Forbearance Risk in relation
to Reﬁnancing Risk, Transition from
LIBOR to risk-free rates, SC Ventures (the
Group’s ﬁnancial technology investment
entity) governance, IRB Models Status
and Performance.
Based on the information received, the
directors considered the principal
uncertainties as well as the principal
risks in their assessment of the Group’s
viability, how these impact the risk proﬁle,
performance and viability of the Group
and any speciﬁc mitigating or remedial
actions necessary.

Avoidable blindness is a key health issue across
our markets. In 2003, to celebrate the Bank’s
150th anniversary, our employees committed to
raise enough money for 28,000 sight-restoring

They succeeded and their commitment grew into
Seeing is Believing (SiB), our global initiative to
tackle avoidable blindness and visual impairment.
In 2011, we set an ambitious target to raise
$100 million for SiB between 2003 and 2020, through
fundraising and Bank-matching. This year, we
reached that target two years early, raising a total
of $103.6 million.

Chairman’s letter

“The Board took the opportunity
to examine some of the broader
global trends shaping the industry
and impacting our business”
Dear Shareholder,
This year, the Board, alongside the Management Team, has been
focused on delivering stronger performance with the ultimate objective
of achieving our purpose – driving commerce and prosperity through
our unique diversity. We have continued to make signiﬁcant progress
in reshaping and strengthening the Group through 2018, improving
ﬁnancial returns, enhancing the Group’s resilience and strengthening
the performance culture and overall culture in line with the Group’s
valued behaviours. As a Board, one of our key responsibilities is to set
the strategic direction for the Group, approve the strategy and hold
management accountable for its execution.
During 2018, the Board also took the opportunity to examine some
of the broader global trends shaping the industry and impacting
our business – including geopolitical and economic factors, cyber
threats, the rapidly changing nature of technology and the increasing
competition coming from the ﬁntech and Big Tech sectors. This has
helped us develop a clearer vision of the Group over the long term and
better orientate the evolution of our strategy. Some of the key areas
discussed and reviewed by the Board during the year are detailed
on page 66.
While the composition of the Board remained unchanged during
the year, the Governance and Nomination Committee spent a
signiﬁcant amount of time discussing Board succession, in particular
identifying an independent non-executive director with a diverse and
varied background from the Greater China and North Asia region.
This wide-ranging search culminated in the appointment of Carlson
Tong to the Board on 21 February 2019. Carlson has over 30 years’
experience operating in one of our key regions and with signiﬁcant
experience and knowledge of the ﬁnancial services sector in mainland
China and Hong Kong. More details on Carlson and the other Board
members can be viewed on pages 57 to 59.
Alongside Carlson’s appointment we announced Dr Han Seung-soo’s
retirement from the Board. I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Dr Han for his substantial contributions to the Group over the past nine
years, as well as his considerable insight into Asia, particularly Korea.
Om Bhatt also stepped down from the Board as an independent
non-executive director. I would like to thank Om for his important
contribution to the Group over the past six years, in particular his
insight into banking and India.

56

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

During the year, the Board continued to deepen its insight into our
markets and understand the opportunities and the progress we are
making in delivering on our strategic priorities. More detail can be
found on pages 18 and 19. As a Board, we collectively visited three
very different markets during 2018, holding our meetings in India,
Nigeria and Korea. Alongside these Board and committee meetings
we also met with our clients and other stakeholders, including
engaging with our local colleagues.
The UK’s Corporate Governance framework has continued to evolve
with the Financial Reporting Council’s publication of its new UK
Corporate Governance Code. The new Code places more emphasis
on the application of an updated set of principles focused on the value
of good corporate governance to companies’ long-term success.
The Governance and Nomination Committee, on behalf of the Board,
oversaw the work to assess the impact of the new Code on the
Group. This included a focus on stakeholders, particularly formalising
a mechanism for an effective two-way engagement with our
workforce. Further details on the review can be found on page 87.
We will report against the new Code in full in next year’s Corporate
Governance report; however, where practical to do so we have
measured ourselves against the new Code this year.
As a Group we have taken measures to ensure that following the
UK’s departure from the European Union in 2019, we can continue
supporting our clients across Europe. Securing a full banking licence
for our new subsidiary in Germany strengthens our footprint in
Europe and supports the growth we expect to achieve in our
European business.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its committees for their
more detailed oversight and receives updates throughout the year on
how they discharge their responsibilities. Further details on the areas
each committee has considered during 2018 can be found in the
individual committee sections within this report.

Code compliance
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the
Code) and the Hong Kong Corporate Governance
Code contained in Appendix 14 of the Hong Kong
Listing Rules (HK Code) are the standards against
which we measured ourselves in 2018. While the
UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (2018
Code) does not come into effect until 1 January
2019, where practical to do so we have applied
some provisions of the 2018 Code early.
The directors are pleased to conﬁrm that
Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) complied
with all of the provisions set out in the Code and
the HK Code for the year under review.
Throughout this corporate governance report
we have provided an insight of how governance
operates within the Group and our application of
the principles set out in the Code and HK Code.

Supplementary information

The Board discharges some of its
responsibilities directly and delegates certain
other responsibilities to its committees to
assist it in carrying out its function of ensuring
independent oversight and stewardship.
Details of the main topics discussed by the
committees in 2018 can be found in this
report. The Board also delegates authority for
the operational management of the Group’s
business to the Group Chief Executive for
further delegation by him in respect of
matters that are necessary for the effective
day-to-day running and management of the
business. The Board holds the Group Chief
Executive accountable in discharging his
delegated responsibilities.

A clear schedule of matters reserved for the
Board and terms of reference for each of its
committees are reviewed annually against
industry best practice and corporate
governance provisions and guidance,
including the Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA) Supervisory Statement on Board
Responsibilities. With the exception of the
Governance and Nomination Committee,
which in line with best practice is chaired by
the Group Chairman, and the Board Financial
Crime Risk Committee, which includes three
external adviser members, all of the Board
committees comprise solely independent
non-executive directors who bring a diversity
of skills, experience and knowledge to the
discussion, and play an important role in
supporting the Board.

Independence of directors
The Chairman is committed to ensuring
that the Board comprises a majority of
independent non-executive directors.
In determining whether a non-executive
director is independent, the Board considers
each individual against the criteria set out
in the UK Corporate Governance Code
and the Hong Kong Listing Rules, and also
considers their contribution and conduct
at Board meetings, including how they
demonstrate objective judgement and
independent thinking.
The Board considers all of the nonexecutive directors to be independent of
Standard Chartered and has concluded that
there are no relationships or circumstances
likely to impair any individual non-executive
director’s judgement.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Engaging in
our markets

In 2018, our independent non-executive directors made a signiﬁcant
number of visits to our markets both collectively as a Board and
independently. These trips continue to provide the independent
non-executive directors with a signiﬁcant on-the-ground understanding
of the markets, the opportunities and the risks we face, and to test the
Group’s strategy. In addition, the overseas Board meetings and adjoining
organised programmes enable the Board to meet with the Group’s
senior management, and key internal and external stakeholder groups
throughout the network, including clients, employees, regulators,
shareholders and others.
In 2018, the Chairman, our independent non-executive directors and the
external adviser members to the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee
made 85 visits across our markets, which included three overseas Board
meeting programmes, held in Mumbai, Lagos and Seoul.

Seoul, South Korea
The Board met with some major
technology client companies and
took the opportunity to engage
directly with local employees on
a range of topics.

Lagos, Nigeria
As part of the Board’s visit to
Nigeria, directors took part in
an interactive session with
participants of the Goal
programme, which aims to
empower girls with conﬁdence,
knowledge and skills they
need to fulﬁl their economic
and leadership potential.

Mumbai, India
Directors discussed some of
the key tech projects which are
improving our client experience
and received a demonstration
of our real-time on-boarding and
live account opening solution.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Corporate governance

External directorships and other
business interests
Board members hold external directorships
and other outside business interests.
We recognise the beneﬁts that greater
boardroom exposure provides our directors.
However, we closely monitor the number
of directorships our directors take on to
satisfy ourselves that any appointment
will not adversely impact their role at
Standard Chartered and that all of our
Board members are compliant with the
PRA requirements and shareholder advisory
groups’ guidance on ‘over-boarding’. These
requirements impose a limit on the number of
directorships both executive and independent
non-executive directors are permitted to hold.
Details of the directors’ external directorships
can be found in their biographies on pages
57 to 59. Before committing to an additional
appointment, directors conﬁrm the existence
of any potential or actual conﬂicts; that the
role will not breach their limit as set out by the
PRA; and provide the necessary assurance
that the appointment will not adversely
impact their ability to continue to fulﬁl their
role as a director of the Group. The Board’s
executive directors are permitted to hold
only one non-executive directorship. Of our
executive directors, Bill Winters is a non-

executive director of Novartis International
AG, listed on SIX Swiss Exchange and Andy
Halford is the senior independent director at
Marks and Spencer Group plc, listed on the
FTSE 100.

Time commitment
Our independent non-executive directors
commit sufﬁcient time in discharging their
responsibilities. In general, we estimate that
each independent non-executive director
spent approximately 35 to 50 days on
Board-related duties, and considerably
more for those who chair or are members
of multiple committees.

Ongoing development plans
Training and development of our directors
does not end following their induction;
ongoing and continual development of our
Board directors is crucial to ensure that
they remain highly engaged, effective and
well-informed. In addition, mandatory
training and ongoing engagement plans
are a key element of director’s ﬁt and
proper assessment as required under the
Senior Managers Regime. During the year,
all directors received a combination of
mandatory training, brieﬁngs, presentations,
guest speakers and papers on a range of

subjects to ensure that each director’s
contribution to the Board remains relevant,
that they are updated of their duties,
responsibilities and obligations as directors
and are well informed of changes to the
regulatory environment. In addition, this year
the Board took the opportunity to consider
some of the broader issues impacting the
industry and the business across its markets
over the medium to long term.
Director’s ongoing training took the form of:
refresher training on their statutory duties,
responsibilities and obligations; a review
of the changes to corporate governance
in 2018, with a particular focus on the
introduction of the new UK Corporate
Governance Code 2018; managing conﬂicts
of interest; brieﬁngs on the market
perceptions of the Group; a discussion on
the future of banking; training and insight
into emerging technologies; IBOR transition
training; and a presentation from the
Singularity University. The table below
details who received these brieﬁngs.
Support is provided to the directors by the
Group Company Secretary and the Group

Board and committee effectiveness
The annual Board Effectiveness Review provides the Board with an opportunity to consider and reﬂect on the effectiveness of its decisionmaking, the range and level of discussion, the quality of its decision-making and for each member to consider their own contribution and
performance. Following last year’s externally facilitated review, this year the review was facilitated internally by the Group Company Secretary,
who is well placed as an independent sounding board to the process. The approach we took was to explore some of the themes from last
year’s action plan and design a questionnaire to understand where improvements had been made and where further focus is needed.
The responses to the questionnaire were supplemented with a one-to-one meeting between each Board member and the Chairman, with
additional input from the Senior Independent Director. These meetings took place during November and December 2018. The key themes
were shared with the Board along with a 2019 action plan.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Board Effectiveness Review
Key observations from the
Board Effectiveness Review
i) Continued focus on ensuring the optimum
balance between geographical
representation and other expertise,
particularly technology, on the Board

iii) Enable Board members to maximise their
engagement at meetings
iv) Maintain the collegiate, open and inclusive
culture which exists on the Board

v) Focus on ensuring Board and
committee meetings are conducted
with greater efﬁciency

In 2018, to supplement the ongoing
feedback, this year’s Committee
Effectiveness Reviews took a similar
approach to the Board and consisted
of questions relating to the individual
committees and how they operate. The
Brand, Values and Conduct Committee
took a slightly different approach and held a
discussion based on a number of themes.
The key observations from each of these
reviews can be seen in the table below.

Financial statements

vi) Greater clarity where strategic input
is required from the Board

Committee Effectiveness Review
Throughout the year, the committees
provide real time feedback on the quality of
the management information they receive
and provide input into the rolling agenda
through requests for updates on particular
matters or enhanced reporting

Risk review and Capital review

ii) Further exploration into the strategy of
key businesses

Board action plan 2019
¼ Ensure succession plans strike the
right balance of skills, knowledge,
experience, diversity, geographical and
other representations to support the
Board’s composition
¼ Make sufﬁcient space on the Board
agenda for broad strategic discussion
as well as deeper dives into the strategy
of the Group’s key businesses
¼ Review rolling agendas and the scheduling
of future Board and committee meetings
¼ Continue to hold regular Board dinners
and events and ensure that the Board
programmes include sufﬁcient time for
open discussion
¼ Committee chairs to make agendas as
strategically focused as possible in order
to make best use of available time.
Chair and members to use pre-meetings
to agree the key areas for focus
¼ Produce revised principles for Board
and committee paper authors, providing
greater clarity on drafting papers to
facilitate strategic discussion including
questions where appropriate

Key observations arising from the 2018 Committee Effectiveness Review
The broad message was that the Committee continued to be thorough and effective and that following feedback received
as part of the 2017 Committee Effectiveness Review, management reporting to the Committee had been enhanced.
Work to improve the quality of the management reporting to the Committee will continue to be an area of focus in 2019

Board Risk
Committee

Overall, the Committee is viewed as managing risk in a sensible and diligent manner. It was acknowledged that there is
a requirement for the Committee to consider a number of regulatory matters. While the quality of the reporting to the
Committee has continued to improve, there remains a need for continued focus on the level of detail and volume of
reporting to the Committee so as to assist it in effectively discharging its responsibilities

Board Financial
Crime Risk
Committee

The Committee has continued to be successful in discharging its responsibilities. The geographical representation and
diverse background of the three adviser members provides valuable input and allows for different perspectives to
be considered

Governance and
Nomination
Committee

The main observation is that the Committee is operating well and that there is a healthy and open atmosphere which
promotes honest discussion. Three themes arising from the feedback concerned ensuring greater ﬂexibility within the
agenda; maintaining sufﬁcient time for effective discussion; and delivering agreed outputs swiftly

Brand, Values
and Conduct
Committee

The Committee’s discussion provided a number of positive observations and suggestions for further enhancing its
operations; these included increased focus on the Group’s sustainability agenda; and expanding the Committee’s remit
to ensure effective reporting of the workforce policy requirements in the new 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code

Remuneration
Committee

Overall, it is recognised that the Committee is operating effectively, demonstrating strong leadership. Management
information it receives is very good and well balanced. The key themes emerging from the review were the need for
sufﬁcient historical information to provide context and sufﬁcient information on regulatory issues and social trends

Corporate governance

Directors’ performance
During 2018, José Viñals met with each
of the directors to evaluate their individual
performance. The performance reviews are
used as the basis for recommending the
re-election of directors by shareholders
and to assist the Chairman in assessing
whether each director continues to
contribute effectively and demonstrate
their commitment to the role, including
time commitment for Board and committee
meetings and other duties.

For each of the independent non-executive
directors, the discussion between the
independent non-executive directors and
the Chairman included consideration of:

Chairman’s performance

¼

Assessment against the core
competencies

¼

Their time commitment, including (where
relevant) the potential impact of any
outside interests

¼

The Board’s composition, taking into
account the combination of skills,
experience and knowledge and when
each independent non-executive director
envisaged stepping down from the Board

¼

The current and future committee
membership and structure

The Senior Independent Director met with
each of the independent non-executive
directors separately, to seek their views
on the Chairman’s performance. These
meetings took place before the independent
non-executive directors met collectively at
a private meeting without the Chairman
present, to evaluate his performance.
The views of the executive directors were
taken into account as part of this evaluation.
The feedback was collated and given to
José Viñals.

Engagement with shareholders
Our approach
We aim to deliver robust returns and
long-term sustainable value for our
shareholders. Trusted and open relationships
with our investors are important to us and
we believe strengthened by ensuring we
consistently and openly seek feedback.
The Chairman and other Board directors
maintain direct contact with investors and
advisory voting bodies and receive regular
updates from the Investor Relations team
including reports on market and investor
sentiment.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

During the year, we maintained a
comprehensive programme of engagement
with investors and other key stakeholders,
including investor advisory bodies and credit
rating agencies, and provided updates on
progress made to secure our foundations
and the steps being taken to reposition the
Group for improved returns.
José Viñals and other independent nonexecutive directors spent a time engaging
with shareholders including at the AGM
and the Chairman’s annual stewardship
and strategy forum. In addition, Christine
Hodgson, Chair of the Remuneration
Committee, continued to discuss with
and collect feedback from shareholders
on remuneration matters.

Bill Winters and Andy Halford are the primary
spokespeople for the Group. Throughout the
year they engaged extensively with existing
shareholders and potential new investors
during individual or group meetings and on
either roadshows or at investor conferences.
In addition, each member of the
Management Team responsible for a client
segment or a geographic region met with
investors to promote greater awareness
and understanding of the strategy in their
respective areas, as well as taking the
opportunity to receive investor feedback
ﬁrst hand.

The Group maintains a diverse, high-quality
and predominantly institutional shareholder
base. The Investor Relations team has
primary responsibility for managing day-today communications with these shareholders
and provides support to the Group
Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, other Board members
and senior management in conducting a
comprehensive engagement programme.

The Group Company Secretary oversees
communication with our retail shareholders.
Our AGM held on 9 May 2018 provided an
opportunity for the Board to meet with our
retail shareholders, listen to their views and
respond to their questions. It was wellattended and all of the proposed resolutions
were passed with shareholder support for
each ranging from 95.35 to 99.95 per cent.

ii) In conjunction with the Chair of the Board
Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Board
Risk Committee Chair hosted its annual
call with the chairs of the subsidiary board
risk committees, and where the Group’s
subsidiaries do not have a risk committee,
the chairs of the board audit committees.
The Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer and Group
Company Secretary also participated in
the call.
iii) In September 2018, the Group Chairman
hosted an annual call with the independent
directors of the Group’s banking
subsidiaries. The Group Company
Secretary also participated in the call.

lead audit partner of the Group’s statutory
auditor and the Group Company Secretary
also participated in the call.

Financial statements

Retail shareholders programme

In addition, the committees strive to ensure
that appropriate linkages are in place with
the subsidiary board committees. This is
achieved in a variety of ways:
Risk review and Capital review

Our Treasury team has primary responsibility
for managing the Group’s relationships with
debt investors and the three major rating
agencies with country chief executives and
chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcers leading on subsidiary
ratings. In 2018, management met with debt
investors across Europe, North America
and Asia and maintained a regular dialogue
with the rating agencies. It is important that
the Group, as an active issuer of senior
unsecured and non-equity capital maintains
regular contact with debt investors to ensure
continued appetite for the Group’s credit.
The Group’s credit ratings are an important
part of the external perception of our
ﬁnancial strength and creditworthiness.

The Board places signiﬁcant reliance on
its committees by delegating a broad
range of responsibilities and issues to them.
It therefore remains crucial that effective
linkages are in place between the committees
and the Board as a whole, not least as it is
impracticable for all independent nonexecutive directors to be members of all of
the committees. Mechanisms are in place to
facilitate these linkages, including ensuring
that there are no gaps or unnecessary
duplications between the remit of each
committee and overlapping membership
between Board committees. Alongside
interconnected committee membership,
the Board receives a written summary of
each of the committee’s meetings and
verbal updates as necessary.

experience and knowledge of ﬁnancial reporting
in international business.
Details of their experience can be found on pages 57
to 59. All the Committee members are independent.

Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee’s role is to review, on behalf of the
Board, the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls. It is also
responsible for oversight and advice to the Board
on matters relating to ﬁnancial reporting and has
exercised oversight of the work undertaken by
Group Compliance, Group Internal Audit and the
Group’s statutory auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG).

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

In addition to the disclosure requirements relating to audit committees under the UK
Corporate Governance Code, the following report sets out the areas of signiﬁcant and
particular focus for the Committee and its activities over the course of the year, as well as
the review undertaken on the effectiveness of the Group’s statutory auditor KPMG LLP
(KPMG) and the assurance the Committee has sought and been provided with
concerning the resourcing and effectiveness of the Group Finance, Group Internal
Audit and Compliance functions.
The Committee has exercised its authority delegated by the Board for ensuring the
integrity of the Group’s published ﬁnancial information by discussing and challenging
the judgements made by management, and the assumptions and estimates on which
they are based. Particular areas considered for the year ended 31 December 2018
included impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, valuation of ﬁnancial
instruments held at fair value, provisions for legal and regulatory matters, carrying value
of investments in associates and joint ventures, ship and aircraft leasing assets and the
recoverability of parent company investments in subsidiaries.
As this was the ﬁrst year following the implementation of IFRS 9, the Committee spent
signiﬁcant time on the results and operation of the new models and methodology.
The Committee has exercised judgement in deciding which of the issues we considered
in the ﬁnancial statements as being signiﬁcant and this report sets out the material
matters that we have considered in these deliberations and details of the action taken
for these key areas can be found on page 73 of this report.
Following the decision taken in 2017 to change external auditors, in 2018, the Committee
received progress reports on the transition to EY as the Group’s auditor by 2020
including their meeting of independence requirements by 1 January 2019 (for certain
engagements) and completely by June 2019.
We have continued to receive and discuss regular updates on the Group’s Speaking Up
programme and have discussed the annual report on the operation and effectiveness of
the programme that was subsequently tabled to the Board.
Through its work in 2018, the Committee has provided assurance to the Board regarding
the quality and effectiveness of ﬁnancial reporting and on regulatory, compliance and
internal audit matters, thereby protecting the interests of shareholders.

Speaking Up
programme

The Group’s Speaking Up programme has been designed to comply with the Group’s UK lead regulators, the PRA and
the Financial Conduct Authority Whistleblowing Rules
Our whistleblowing channels, (sc.com/speakingup) are available to anyone – colleagues, contractors, suppliers and
members of the public – to raise concerns conﬁdentially and anonymously

disclosures received, referral rates and the number of open Speaking Up investigations and the time taken to close
such investigations
Over the course of the year, Naguib met regularly with the Group Head, Speaking Up and also met with a number of
Speaking Up advocates in several of the Group’s jurisdictions. He was also personally involved in overseeing a number
of cases which were referred to him in his capacity as the Board’s Whistleblowing Champion
The Committee discussed an annual report on the operation and effectiveness of the Speaking Up programme that was
subsequently tabled to the Board. The report provided the Committee with assurance of the Group’s ongoing compliance
with the Whistleblowing Rules

Interaction with On an annual basis, the Committee meets with the PRA without members of management being present. The purpose
regulators
of such meetings is to enable a discussion between the Committee and the PRA concerning areas of focus for both the

The Committee’s membership comprises
independent non-executive directors who have a deep
and broad experience of banking and the risk factors
affecting the Group. Details of their experience can be

Main responsibilities of the Committee

The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas
of focus following each Committee meeting.
* In the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for
a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other
Board committees where the remit of these other committees
clearly cover risk related matters. For example, the Audit
Committee has oversight of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial
controls and regulatory compliance; the Board Financial Crime
Risk Committee has oversight of the responsibilities in relation to
ﬁnancial crime compliance matters; and the Brand, Values and
Conduct Committee has oversight of the processes by which
reputational risk is managed.

The Committee has written terms of reference that
can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference

The Committee has discussed the steps taken by Management in 2018 to maintain
lower credit impairment and improvements in asset quality, thereby strengthening the
Group’s risk position.
Although the Group’s portfolios remain strong and well diversiﬁed the Committee has
discussed the broader geopolitical uncertainties that continue to affect sentiment in
some of the Group’s markets. Through a combination of Management reporting and
speciﬁc Committee requests, the Committee has discussed Management’s focus on
early identiﬁcation of emerging risks across all of the Group’s portfolios to ensure that
any areas of weakness are being managed on a proactive basis.
The Committee considers both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial risk, we have sought and
received assurance that Management has and continues to consider risk throughout
the Group’s business and that areas which require improvement are receiving
appropriate Management attention and new threats to the Group’s business are
identiﬁed and addressed.
One particular area of focus for the Committee has been the threat posed by Information
and Cyber Security across many industries including ﬁnancial services. Information and
Cyber Security Risk was identiﬁed as one of the Group’s Principal Risk Types in 2017.
In 2018 the Committee discussed the work undertaken to increase capabilities and
enhance operating models to better manage this risk. Sir Iain Lobban, who is the Board
Adviser on Cyber and an Adviser member of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee
has participated in the Committee’s discussions on this topic and both the Committee
and Management have beneﬁted from Sir Iain’s external expertise in this area. Although
there is still work to be done to enhance capabilities, this will further strengthen the
Group’s defences and assist in keeping pace with the evolving cyber threat landscape.
We have discussed the principal uncertainties that the Group faces and the steps being
taken to manage them, further details of which can be found on page 41.

Supplementary information

The Committee is responsible for exercising
oversight of and reviewing prudential risk. It reviews
the Group’s overall Risk Appetite Statement and
makes recommendations thereon to the Board.
Its responsibilities also include reviewing the
appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group’s risk
management systems, considering the implications
of material regulatory change proposals, reviewing
reports on principal risks to the Group’s business
and ensuring effective due diligence on material
acquisitions and disposals.

Risk management is essential to consistent and sustainable performance for all of our
stakeholders. Throughout 2018 and through management reporting to the Committee,
it is clear that awareness of the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework
has increased, leading to a stronger risk culture across the three lines of defence.
The Group’s risk framework provides guiding principles for the behaviours expected
from our people when managing risk.

Financial statements

As part of, and in addition to, each scheduled
Committee meeting, the Committee had private
members-only meetings.

The Committee’s role is to exercise oversight on behalf of the Board of Group-wide
risks,* and to provide assurance to the Board that the overall framework for complying
with the Risk Management Principles and the Board approved Risk Appetite Statement
is operating effectively.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

“The Group’s risk framework
provides guiding principles for
the behaviours expected from
our people when managing risk”

The Committee’s discussions included an overview of the changes to the Risk function
in 2018 and Management’s forward-looking view of the Risk function over the next ﬁve
to 10 years designed to enable the Risk function to evolve signiﬁcantly as it enables
business strategy and reacts to the changing external environment.
The following pages provide further insight into the workings of the Committee and its
activities for the year.

Activities in the year
Risk Appetite

Closely followed and challenged the formulation of the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement in order to assure that it is
effective in setting appropriate boundaries in respect of Principal Risk Types
Considered and recommended to the Board for approval the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement. As part of the 2018
review of Risk Appetite, emphasis was placed on leading indicators and inherent risk metrics to support a more
informed risk decision-making process. New metrics were proposed to and approved by the Committee for Capital
and Liquidity to capture Interest Rate Risk in the banking book, double leverage and minimum requirement for own
funds and eligible liabilities
As Financial Risk Appetite metrics are now considered more mature and well embedded within the Group, greater
focus was given to developing metrics for non-ﬁnancial Principal Risk Types to align with the roll out of the Group’s
new Risk Type Frameworks and to take into account increased regulatory scrutiny on operational resilience and
heightened Information and Cyber Security risks
New inherent risk metrics were proposed and approved for Information and Cyber Security, Operational Risk
(to focus on operational resilience associated with system obsolescence and critical third-party risks), Compliance
(to provide insight to material regulatory actions and adverse regulatory relationships) and for Financial Crime
(to measure the level of concentration to higher-risk-rated clients)
Monitored actual exposures relative to Risk Appetite limits using regular risk information reports provided
by management
Tracked a wide range of risk metrics that are periodically reported to the Committee
Further details of the Group’s Risk Appetite are set out on page 194

Principal Risk Types The Group’s Principal Risk Types are reported on at each scheduled Committee meeting through a Board Risk
Information Report which accompanies the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer’s Report. In addition to this reporting, the
Committee has had deeper discussions on the following topics:
¼

Information and Cyber Security Risk:

Information and Cyber Security Risk is the potential for loss from a breach of conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of
the Group’s information systems and assets through cyber-attack, insider activity, error or control failure. The Group
has continued its increased focus on cyber risk management capabilities. Cyber risk is a continually evolving threat
for the ﬁnancial services industry and high-proﬁle security breaches were a recurring focus in the media and among
regulators throughout 2018
The Committee discussed reports from management on the work to improve the Group’s defences and create a
stronger control framework. In addition to this reporting, the Committee discussed:
¼

An external assessment by Booz Allen Hamilton of the Group’s Information and Cyber Security controls

¼

The Marsh and TheCityUK Report on Governing Cyber Risk – A Guide for Company Boards

Sir Iain Lobban, who is one of the external adviser members of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee and an
independent adviser to the PLC Board on cyber and security threats, joined the Committee meetings for these
discussions together with the Group Chief Information Ofﬁcer and the Chief Information Security Ofﬁcer
¼

Operational risk:

The Group deﬁnes operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and
systems, human error, or from the impact of external events
The Committee:

¼

–

Reviewed and recommended to the Board new metrics for Operational Risk to focus on operational resilience
associated with system obsolescence and critical third-party risks

–

Received updates on Operational Risk Events requiring root cause reviews including trend analysis and themes

Capital Risk and Liquidity Risk:

Capital Risk is the potential for insufﬁcient level or composition of capital to support the Group’s normal activities.
Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Group may not have sufﬁcient stable or diverse sources of funding to meet its
obligations as they fall due. The Committee receives a Treasurer’s report which covers market developments,
liquidity, capital, recovery and resolution planning together with rating agency updates. During the year, the
Committee considered and discussed the Group’s capital and liquidity position and the regulatory environment
including the approval of the regulatory submissions of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
(in order to satisfy itself that the Group’s approach to capital planning is comprehensive, rigorous and consistent
with both the current regulatory requirements and the likely anticipated outlook) and the Group’s Individual Liquidity
Adequacy Assessment Process (which considers the Group’s liquidity position, its framework and whether sufﬁcient
liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due)
Further details concerning the Group’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio are set out on page 185 and details concerning
Capital are set out on page 218

¼

Output from Enterprise Risk Management Forum

The Enterprise Risk Management Forum provides an integrated platform for all the Risk Framework Owners and the
regional and client-business Chief Risk Ofﬁcers to discuss the key themes relevant to the Group’s Principal Risk
Types. Global Research, Group Strategy, Corporate Communications and Business representatives also participate
and provide insights from an external lens perspective on risk themes, threats and opportunities. The outputs are
used to maintain a dynamic risk inventory for the Group covering the 10 Principal Risk Types and the relative
movements in their sub-types, emerging risks and principal uncertainties. Reporting to the Committee covered the
key risk themes emerging from the Forum’s discussions that were deemed to be moderate or potentially material for
the Group and actions that are being undertaken to understand these better

Transition from LIBOR to risk-free rates

In July 2017, the FCA announced that it would no longer support the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after
2021, signalling that LIBOR may cease to exist, at least in its current form, beyond that date. The Committee was

¼

Internal Ratings Based (IRB) models status and performance

Received and discussed an update on the status and performance of the IRB models and sought and received
assurance that the IRB models continue to perform adequately and remain conservative against actual performance

The Committee is authorised to investigate
or seek any information relating to an activity
within its Terms of Reference and receives
regular reports on risk management and
tracks a wide range of risk metrics through
a risk information report. This report provides
an overview of the Group’s risk proﬁle
against the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement.
The Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer’s report
covers the macroeconomic environment,
geopolitical outlook, material disclosures
and ongoing risks.

The Committee has the authority to request
and receive relevant information consistent
with the requirements of BCBS 239 that
will allow the Committee to fulﬁl its
governance mandate relating to risks to
which the Group is exposed, and alert
senior management when risk reports
do not meet its requirements.

Risk management disclosures
The Committee has reviewed the risk
disclosures in the Annual Report and
Accounts and the Half Year Report and has
also reviewed and approved the disclosures
regarding the work of the Committee.

Interaction with the Group
Chief Risk Ofﬁcer
As Committee Chair, David Conner meets
individually with the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer
and the Committee has also met privately
with the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer without
other members of management being
present. These meetings allow open
discussion of any matters relating to
issues arising from the Committee’s
formal discussions.

81

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Corporate governance

Interaction with management
The Committee is mindful of the need
to hold management directly accountable
when issues have arisen and have been
reported by the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer.
Senior management has attended
Committee meetings for deeper
discussions in such instances.

Interaction with regulators
As Committee Chair, David Conner meets
periodically with one of the Group’s UK lead
regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA). In addition, and on an annual basis,
the Committee meets with the PRA without
members of management being present.
The purpose of such meetings is to enable a
discussion between the Committee and the
PRA concerning prudential focused topics.

Interaction between
Board committees on
risk related issues
In the few instances where it does not have
primary oversight for a given type of risk, the
Committee interacts closely with other Board
committees where the remit of these other
committees clearly covers risk related
matters. For example, the Audit Committee
has oversight of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial
controls and regulatory compliance; the
Board Financial Crime Risk Committee has
oversight of the responsibilities in relation to
ﬁnancial crime compliance matters; and the
Brand, Values and Conduct Committee
has oversight of the mechanisms by which
reputational risk is managed. The interaction
assists the Committee in ensuring that it is
well informed on discussions held, and the
close collaboration of the committee chairs
helps to ensure that there are no gaps and
any potential for unnecessary duplication
is avoided.

Risk function resourcing
The Committee has sought and received
assurance that the Risk function is
adequately resourced to perform its function
effectively. The Committee’s discussions
included an overview of the changes to the
Risk function in 2018 and management’s
forward-looking view of the Risk function
over the next ﬁve to 10 years.

Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing the
Group’s brand, culture, valued behaviours and
conduct, as well as the processes by which the Group
identiﬁes and manages reputational risk, sustainability
priorities and the approach to main government and
regulatory relationships.

The Committee has written terms of reference that
can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference

We followed through on last year’s review of how the Group manages Reputational Risk,
monitoring the fulﬁlment of recommendations in 2017 from Group Internal Audit, in particular
the development and implementation of a Reputation Risk Framework, which we now use
to assess how well this risk is managed by the Group.
The Committee continued to seek assurance more broadly from Group Internal Audit, where
the approach to assessing culture continues to develop using a mix of quantitative and
anecdotal evidence. We also considered the Speaking Up and Grievance reports prepared
for the Audit Committee, as well as the My Voice employee engagement survey and results
from other tools to inform our assessment of performance and risk across our remit.
We discussed the progress on the Brand Refresh Campaign, the Group’s ﬁrst major global
brand campaign since 2014, which saw a continuation of our Here for good brand promise.
We reviewed the performance of the campaign against the agreed brand metrics and
considered how the Group plans to maximise the potential of its future marketing efforts.
One of our Committee meetings in 2018 was held in India, which provided the opportunity
to engage with employees and partner organisations to obtain ﬁrst hand insights on brand,
culture and reputational matters at a local level. In addition, Committee members between
them visited 11 other countries, furnished with a readout of the culture dashboard for that
market, prompting rich dialogue with local management and stakeholders.
Committee members also participated in the Group’s Community Engagement work,
including the celebrations of the 15-year anniversary of Seeing is Believing (SiB), our global
programme to tackle avoidable blindness and visual impairment, and the announcement that
we surpassed our $100 million fundraising target for SiB and reached 176 million people from
2003 to 2018. With this SiB milestone achieved, the Committee endorsed the Group’ s new
Community Engagement strategy that aims to tackle inequality and promote economic
inclusion for disadvantaged young people in our markets.

Supplementary information

The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas
of focus following each Committee meeting.

Having paid particular attention to Culture in previous years, we received regular reports on
how the Group’s Valued Behaviours are being embedded and the resulting outcomes. We
spurred on the crystallisation of our desired culture and continued with our regular review of
the Group Culture Dashboard designed to help assess progress against this. To complement
this view, we encouraged the development of a Group Conduct Dashboard; the intention
being to regularly review these two views of the business in conjunction. We gave input to
a working demonstration of this new Dashboard and look forward to future reports on how
this is used to highlight areas of attention and best practice at all levels within the Group.

Financial statements

Dr B E Grote attended one of the Committee
meetings in 2018 as part of his ongoing
engagement programme.

The area of most signiﬁcant progress was Sustainability. In March 2018, the Board agreed
a refreshed Sustainability Philosophy and strategy to support sustainable and responsible
growth through our operations, client relationships and community programmes. We aim
to demonstrate our leadership in sustainability with continued progress on all facets of
Environmental, Social and Governance standards across the Group. We have also refreshed
our framework of Position Statements, making explicit the challenges and trade-offs we
need to consider, and taking a forward-leading position on fossil fuels that was generally
well received by our stakeholders.

Main responsibilities of the Committee

The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas
of focus following each committee meeting.
The Committee has written terms of reference that
can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference

Our focus on succession planning was not conﬁned to discussions on the Board and
its committees, we also considered succession readiness and plans for the executive
directors and other senior executives, to assure ourselves that key roles have plans in
place for the medium term and in the immediate term if required.
The Committee also provided oversight of the annual Board and committee
effectiveness reviews, which were internally facilitated in 2018. More details on the
themes and outcomes can be reviewed on page 69.
Throughout 2018, we also provided support for the implementation of the Group’s
International Advisory Council (IAC). This new initiative will provide signiﬁcant strategic
insight into the changing dynamics of our markets and further enhance the Group’s
relationship with our stakeholders. The Committee provided oversight of the IAC’s
development and reviewed potential Council members. The IAC, chaired by Dominic
Barton had its inaugural meeting on 4 February 2019.
The Committee also spent a great deal of time overseeing its governance
responsibilities, which included reviewing the regional subsidiary governance processes,
considering changes to the Group’s corporate governance arrangements to reﬂect the
proposed new hub entity structure and overseeing the Group’s approach to compliance
with the new UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. The Committee paid particular
attention to the development of initiatives to enable the Board to engage effectively
and directly with our workforce. We will report against the new Code in full in next
year’s report.

Supplementary information

It also keeps under review the leadership needs of,
and succession plans for, the Group in relation to
both executive directors and other senior executives;
has oversight of the process by which the Board,
its committees and individual directors assess their
effectiveness; keeps the diversity of the Board under
review and monitors progress towards achieving
its objectives in this area; considers any potential
situational conﬂicts of interest declared by our Board
members; and considers the impact of material
changes to corporate governance regulation and
legislation affecting the Group, and has oversight
of the Group’s approach to subsidiary corporate
governance.

While the composition of the Board remained unchanged during 2018, the Committee,
conscious of Dr Han Seung-soo’s tenure on the Board, commissioned a wide-ranging
search for an independent non-executive director with particular expertise in the Greater
China & North Asia region. Carlson Tong emerged from that search as a very credible
and well respected candidate. He has signiﬁcant experience and insight of operating
in mainland China and Hong Kong and will bring a fresh perspective to the Board.
The Committee recommended his appointment to the Board in January 2019 and he
joined on 21 February 2019. Dr Han Seung-soo retired and Om Bhatt stepped down
from the Board as independent non-executive directors on 23 February 2019.

Financial statements

The Committee has responsibility for keeping the
size, structure and composition of the Board and its
committees under review. As part of the Committee’s
succession planning, it takes into account the Group’s
strategy and challenges and makes recommendations
to the Board in respect to any adjustments to the
Board’s composition.

The Committee has been active across all areas of its responsibility during 2018, with a
particular focus on further strengthening the composition and succession plans for the
Board and its committees. Ensuring we have a truly diverse Board comprising a range
of perspectives, experiences, knowledge and skills is key to the Board’s continuing
effectiveness. The Board Diversity Policy, which sets out our approach to diversity on the
Board, was once again reviewed by the Committee this year to ensure that we continue
to enhance progress in this area.

Implementation of the Board
Diversity Policy

¼

Ensuring that our Board reﬂects the diverse
markets in which we operate

The Board’s Diversity Policy (the Policy) sets
out the approach the Group takes to diversity
on its Board to ensure that diversity, in its
broadest sense, remains a central feature of
the Board. The Policy acknowledges that we
have a distinctive footprint and international
outlook and a long history of diverse board
membership.

¼

Ensuring that the Board comprises a good
balance of skills, experience, knowledge,
perspective and varied backgrounds

¼

Only engaging search ﬁrms who are
signed up to the Voluntary Code of
Conduct for Executive Search ﬁrms

¼

Reporting annually on the diversity of the
executive pipeline as well as the diversity of
the Board, including progress being made
on reaching the Board’s gender target

We strive to maintain a diverse Board,
recognising the beneﬁts of having a Board
made up of individuals with a diverse mix
of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds,
knowledge, personal attributes, skills and
experience. This diversity provides a mix of
perspectives which contribute to the effective
Board dynamics.
Aligned to this broad objective, the Policy
has ﬁve speciﬁc objectives which the Board
is committed to in order to further enhance
progress in this area:
¼

The Committee conducted an annual review
of the Policy during 2018, to ensure that it
continues to drive diversity in its broadest
sense, while continuing to take account
of best practice initiatives, most recently
the Parker Report into ethnic diversity, the
Hampton-Alexander Review on women
in leadership positions and the new 2018
UK Corporate Governance Code.

The Policy is implemented through the
Committee, which considers the Policy’s
objectives as part of its overall succession
planning discussions as well as part of
its selection and recommendation of
individual candidates.
Details of the Board’s diverse composition
are set out on pages 57 to 59 of this report,
and the diverse make up of Management
Team can be found on pages 60 to 62.
Gender representation across the Group
can be found on page 44 of this report.
A copy of the full Board Diversity Policy can be
viewed at sc.com/boarddiversitypolicy

Progress against the key objectives set out in
the Board Diversity Policy is set out below.

Increasing the representation of women on
the Board with an aim to have a minimum
of 33 per cent female representation

Board Diversity Policy objectives

Progress update

Increasing the representation of
women on the Board with an aim to
have to have a minimum of 33 per cent
female representation

¼

Achieving a more balanced gender representation on the Board is an integral part of the
Board’s succession planning process. The target to have a minimum of 33 per cent female
representation on the Board is now a realistic and welcome reality. The Board has seen
female representation increase from 10 per cent in 2014 to 31 per cent at 31 December
2018

Ensuring that the Board reﬂects the
diverse markets in which we operate

¼

What sets us apart is our diversity of people, cultures and networks. At the end of 2018 the
Board had representation from a mix of our regions in which we operate, including the UK,
US, India, Korea, Hong Kong and Nigeria. As part of the Committee’s Board succession
planning discussions it has considered a range of potential future INED candidates from
across our markets

Ensuring that the Board comprises
a good balance of skills, experience,
knowledge, perspective and varied
backgrounds

¼

Throughout the year the Committee has focused on balancing the composition and make
up of the Board, identifying where skills, experience, knowledge and diversity gaps exist,
both immediately and in the longer term, and systematically reviewed candidate longlists
to strengthen the pipeline of potential future INEDs

Only engaging search ﬁrms who are
signed up to the Voluntary Code of
Conduct for Executive Search ﬁrms

¼

We continue to only engage search ﬁrms signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct.
During 2018, the Committee engaged Egon Zehnder and Heidrick & Struggles to assist
in identifying potential INED candidates and build a pipeline of high quality individuals.
Egon Zehnder and Heidrick & Struggles are both signed up to the Voluntary Code and
are committed in supporting our ambitions to widen all aspects of diversity on the Board

Reporting annually on the diversity
of the executive pipeline as well as
the diversity of the Board, including
progress being made on reaching the
Board’s gender target

¼

We have continued to improve our oversight of Board and senior talent succession
planning as well as highlighting the importance and value placed on diversity in its broadest
sense in the boardroom to continue to ensure that the Board’s effectiveness is enhanced

Head, Financial Crime Compliance; Group Head
Compliance; Group Company Secretary.

As part of, and in addition to, each scheduled
Committee meeting, the Committee had private
members-only meetings.

Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee provides oversight of the
effectiveness of the Group’s policies, procedures,
systems, controls and assurance arrangements
designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor
and prevent and/or detect money laundering,
non-compliance with sanctions, bribery,
corruption and tax crime by third parties.
The Committee reports to the Board on its key
areas of focus following each Committee meeting.

The Group’s refreshed ﬁnancial crime mission is “partnering to lead in the ﬁght against
ﬁnancial crime.” Through its work, the Committee has sought and received assurances
that the Group has the right foundations to succeed in this objective which contains
three core elements. First, ‘partnering’ recognises that ﬁnancial crime risk management
requires more than a ﬁnancial crime compliance function; we need to collaborate closely
with the businesses and functions within the Group. It is also necessary to partner with
external parties such as peer banks, clients, policy makers and law enforcement. ‘Lead’
maintains the Group’s desire to be operating beyond a minimum acceptable level.
The Group aims to raise standards in its markets, leading the industry in speciﬁc areas
of focus and seeking to make ﬁnancial crime compliance a source of competitive
advantage. The third core element, ‘ﬁght against ﬁnancial crime’, is recognition that the
Group aspires to do more than regulatory compliance. Standard Chartered aims to
be active in denying ﬁnancial criminals access to the ﬁnancial system. This element is
directly relevant to the Group’s purpose of “driving commerce and prosperity through
our unique diversity” as ﬁnancial crime undermines prosperity.
Towards the end of 2017, Management prepared a Financial Crime Compliance Global
Threat Assessment, designed to identify and evaluate the most signiﬁcant ﬁnancial crime
threats faced by the Group and to develop a set of key recommendations in response to
these threats. In 2018, the Committee discussed the ﬁnancial crime future threats posed
by virtual currencies, the illegal wildlife trade, and the broader money laundering and
sanctions threats linked to Russia. The Group’s global footprint means that we are well
placed to offer a unique perspective on this last issue.
At the end of 2018, John Cusack stepped down as the Group’s Global Head of Financial
Crime Compliance (FCC) and Patricia Sullivan and David Howes were appointed
Co-Heads of FCC. I would like to thank John for his work in helping the Committee
discharge its responsibilities since its formation in 2015 and welcome David and Patricia
to their new roles.

Supplementary information

The Committee’s membership comprises four
independent non-executive directors and three
independent external adviser members who are
neither directors nor employees of the Group but
who provide a valuable external perspective and
have extensive experience in counter-terrorism,
cyber security and international security. Details on
the independent non-executive directors can be
found in their biographies on pages 57 to 59.

Today, the Group expects to benchmark as being industry leading in the areas of
ﬁnancial crime compliance governance, risk assessment, client risk assessment within
customer due diligence, and reporting. The Group also aspires to be industry leading in
assurance but it is not yet there and the Committee will continue to monitor progress
against achieving this.

Financial statements

Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala also attended a
Committee meeting as part of her ongoing
engagement programme.

Since 2012, the Group has implemented programmes of remediation and
enhancement in managing ﬁnancial crime risk. The Financial Crime Risk Mitigation
Programme (FCRMP) was set up to deliver a signiﬁcant improvement in the Group’s
ﬁnancial crime risk management consistent with our strategic aspiration “to prove that
Standard Chartered is leading the way in combating ﬁnancial crime, while providing
quality service for our clients.” Five years later, we assess that – while there is always
more to do – the Group’s ﬁnancial crime controls framework has been substantially
transformed through a combination of business as usual enhancements and the
workstreams initiated under the FCRMP.

C M Hodgson (Chair)

Our Fair Pay Charter sets out the principles we use to make remuneration decisions
that are fair, transparent, competitive and strongly reﬂect business and individual
performance, supporting us in embedding a high performance culture. Our approach to
remuneration promotes long-term focus and alignment with shareholder interests, and
reﬂects the achievement of ﬁnancial and strategic results as well as the demonstration
of our valued behaviours in pay decisions. We seek to keep remuneration as simple
as possible, ensure we meet all regulatory requirements and incorporate evolving
best practice. In making decisions on remuneration for 2018 for all colleagues, and in
setting the direction for 2019, the Committee considered these principles as well as
the progress made since 2015, the overall performance of the Group in 2018 and our
refreshed strategic priorities for 2019 to 2021.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Directors’ remuneration
report

We believe that our decisions deliver competitive remuneration, fairly
differentiated to reward colleagues for the ﬁnancial and strategic
performance which has delivered the fundamentally stronger platform
off which to grow and transform the business further.
For the year ahead, remuneration decisions will reﬂect our refreshed
strategy for 2019 to deliver our next phase of growth. The strategy
seeks to improve productivity signiﬁcantly and to deliver strong results
to our stakeholders.

Our Fair Pay Charter
Attracting, retaining and motivating a diverse, future-ready workforce
is essential to delivering on our purpose, long-term strategy and
shareholder returns. In support of this, in 2017 the Committee
developed our Fair Pay Charter which sets out the principles we use
to determine and deliver pay for all colleagues globally, including
senior management and executive directors. We are proud to share
in this report more details about how we meet the commitments in
the Charter and our plans for making further progress against the
stretching goals we have set ourselves. One of these goals is to
pay a living wage across all 60 of our markets. During 2018, we
developed our understanding of living wages and took action to
pay all employees at or above this level, meeting our commitment
one year ahead of our target. We have also developed our wellbeing
programme with beneﬁts which underpin our four pillars: mental,
physical, social and ﬁnancial wellbeing, and have begun a multi-year
programme introducing ﬂexibility to allow colleagues to tailor their
beneﬁts to their individual needs.

Remuneration outcomes for 2018
In 2015, we announced a strategic plan to secure the Group’s
foundations, get lean and focused, and invest and innovate.
Substantial progress has been made in executing the strategy.
Underlying proﬁt is four times higher and return on equity (RoE) on an
underlying basis has increased to 4.6 per cent. The quality of our loan
portfolio is greatly improved and our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
ratio has reached 14.2 per cent, which – together with our improved
proﬁtability – allowed us to reinstate the full year and interim dividends
during 2018. The progress made in building a fundamentally stronger
platform is a critical enabler to delivering sustainable returns above
the cost of capital over the medium term. When determining 2018
remuneration outcomes, the Committee:
¼

Considered the importance of rewarding employees for the
improved strategic and ﬁnancial performance in the year. Underlying
proﬁt has increased by 28 per cent year-on-year. Organic capital
generation and enhanced risk management have further increased
the Group’s resilience. Strategic progress has been made including
improved client satisfaction, credit quality and cost savings, growth
in digital volumes and signiﬁcant improvements in innovation

¼

Acknowledged the disappointing share price performance in 2018
and, that despite improved proﬁtability, returns are not yet above the
cost of capital

¼

Took account of current and future risks identiﬁed by the Group’s
Principal Risk Types including operational, conduct, information and
cyber security and ﬁnancial crime risks

¼

Considered the wage inﬂation pressures in many of the emerging
markets in which we operate. 95 per cent of colleagues are based
outside of Europe & Americas

Considering these factors, the Committee concluded that
remuneration outcomes should reﬂect a Group scorecard
assessment of 55 per cent of the maximum. This resulted in
discretionary incentives in 2018 of $1,179 million, representing
an increase of 3 per cent on 2017 compared with a 28 per cent
increase in underlying proﬁt.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The status of historical ﬁnancial crime controls was taken in to
consideration by the Committee when determining historical
incentives and risk adjustments were made at that time. The ongoing
remediation of ﬁnancial crime control issues formed part of the
scorecards used to determine 2018 remuneration outcomes, and
maintaining and enhancing effective ﬁnancial crime compliance
controls is also reﬂected in the scorecards that will be used to
determine 2019 remuneration outcomes. The Committee will continue
to monitor the resolution of the US investigation and the FCA process
and consider it as part of remuneration decision-making as new
information comes to light.

Directors’ remuneration in 2018
Under the existing policy, approved by shareholders in May 2016,
executive directors were eligible for a maximum annual incentive
of 80 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration (see 2018 annual incentive
awards below) and a maximum long-term incentive plan award
of 120 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration (see 2019–21 LTIP awards
to be granted in March 2019 below) in respect of 2018.
2018 annual incentive awards
The Committee determined that Bill and Andy should receive annual
incentives of 50 and 48 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration respectively
based on Group and individual performance (compared with
61 per cent in 2017). Notwithstanding the improvement in Group
performance and the strong personal performance against their
objectives, the more stretching targets set for 2018 and the
Committee’s consideration of other factors including share price
performance during the year resulted in a 17 per cent year-on-year
reduction in the annual incentive award for Bill and an 18 per cent
year-on-year reduction for Andy. Further information on the
determination of the annual incentive awards is provided on
pages 97 to 99.
2019–21 LTIP awards to be granted in March 2019
2019–21 LTIP awards will be granted in March 2019, delivered in
ordinary shares and with a value of 120 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration
at the time of award. Depending on performance over the next three
years, awards will be deferred over seven years and an additional
one-year retention period will apply post-vesting. Performance will
be assessed based on return on tangible equity (RoTE) (with a CET1
underpin), total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group, and
the achievement of strategic measures that are aligned to the Group’s
refreshed strategic priorities; to deliver our network and grow our
afﬂuent business; transform and disrupt with digital; and purpose
and people.
RoTE is one of the ﬁnancial KPIs that will be used to measure
progress against our refreshed strategic priorities (see pages 17 to 19).
The Committee considers target setting carefully before each grant
and is committed to setting targets that are challenging and act as an
effective incentive for executive directors to execute the strategy. The
RoTE target range for 2019–21 LTIP awards is 8 to 11 per cent, which
has been set considering the Group’s current ﬁnancial position and
plan, and the market environment and outlook. The broadly equivalent
RoE range is 7 to 10 per cent which represents a continued increase
in the stretch of our performance targets over recent years, from an
RoE target range of 5 to 8 per cent for the 2017–19 LTIP and from a
range of 6 to 9 per cent for the 2018–20 LTIP. Further information on
the grant of the 2019–21 LTIP awards is provided on pages 99 to 100.
2016–18 LTIP awards vesting in May 2019
The 2016–18 LTIP awards are due to vest in May 2019 and are subject
to performance over three years from 2016 to 2018. Following an
assessment of the performance conditions, 27 per cent of these
awards are expected to vest. This reﬂects zero vesting for the RoE
and TSR measures which are below the threshold targets set and
strong performance against our strategic objectives, securing the
foundations needed to deliver higher returns in the medium-term.

Single total ﬁgure of remuneration for 2018
The 2018 single total ﬁgure of remuneration consists of ﬁxed
remuneration received in 2018, annual incentives relating to 2018
performance (see above section on 2018 annual incentive awards),
and long-term incentives where 2018 is the last year of the
performance cycle (see above section on 2016–18 LTIP awards
vesting in May 2019). The single ﬁgure for Bill for 2018 is £5,950,000
and for Andy is £3,645,000.

A signiﬁcant portion of their total remuneration is delivered in
shares which will be released over the next ﬁve years. The deferral,
retention and recovery provisions reinforce continued alignment
with shareholder interests and the Group’s long-term performance.
Further information on the single total ﬁgure of remuneration is
provided on page 101.

Proposed new directors’ remuneration policy

A simpliﬁed ﬁxed pay structure combining salary and ﬁxed pay
allowances (FPA) into ‘total salary’ delivered as a combination of
cash and shares. This reﬂects that both of these elements are
considered when determining the pay of the executive directors
for their role, skills and experience

¼

For future directors we will set the pension contribution at
10 per cent of total salary in line with the pension contribution rate
for all employees in the UK. For the existing directors, to deliver the
current contractual value and to reﬂect the change to total salary,
pension will be set at 20 per cent of total salary

¼

Signiﬁcantly increased shareholding requirements to 250 per cent
of total salary for the Group Chief Executive and 200 per cent of
total salary for the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. This signiﬁcantly
increases the value of the required holding and changes the
structure of the requirement from a speciﬁed number of shares
to a percentage of total salary, which is more common practice

¼

A new post-employment shareholding requirement of
100 per cent of the shareholding requirement in place for
one year and 50 per cent of the requirement in place in the
second year following cessation of employment

Is retiring from full-time employment in ﬁnancial services and
comparable roles in other industries

¼

Has demonstrated satisfactory conduct and achieved their
performance objectives

¼

Has a Board approved handover plan in place to support the
transition to an identiﬁed successor

If these criteria have been met the Committee would then carefully
consider using its discretion to disapply time proration on a case-bycase basis, taking into account all of the circumstances at that time. If
the ﬂexibility were to be used, typically, there would be no LTIP award
in the ﬁnal year of employment or additional payments in lieu of notice
and there will be clear and detailed disclosure in the subsequent
directors’ remuneration report explaining the circumstances and
why the decision was made. If an executive director retires and
subsequently takes up comparable executive employment again,
unvested awards that had proration disapplied will lapse and the
executive will be expected to re-pay any vested awards.
Details of the proposed directors’ remuneration policy for 2019 and
how it will be implemented are set out on pages 108 to 117.

Directors’ remuneration for 2019
Following a review of ﬁxed remuneration, the Committee noted that
there had been no increase for Bill since his appointment in June
2015. Taking this into account, together with his development in the
role since joining the Group and his remuneration compared with
global peers, the Committee awarded a total salary increase of
3 per cent, from £2,300,000 to £2,370,000, with effect from 1 April
2019. In making this decision the Committee also took into account
the pay increases made to the broader employee population, which
have been, on average, 4 per cent per year since 2015.
Following the review, no increase was made to ﬁxed remuneration
for Andy. His ﬁxed remuneration components will be rebalanced to
maintain the same total ﬁxed remuneration and a similar proportion
of cash under the new policy as currently (details are provided on
page 116).
The Committee will continue to review ﬁxed remuneration annually.
The structure of remuneration in 2019 will be set by the new directors’
remuneration policy being proposed at the May 2019 AGM, which is
summarised above with full details on pages 108 to 115.
We have consulted shareholders extensively as part of reviewing
our directors’ remuneration policy and I would like to thank them for
their engagement and valuable contribution. I look forward to further
engagement with stakeholders during 2019 and hearing your views.

Financial statements

The current policy is well-supported by shareholders (receiving a
94 per cent vote in favour when it was implemented in 2016) and
continues to support the delivery of our long-term strategy. During our
review of the policy, alternative variable remuneration structures were
considered, such as removing the long-term incentive component
and introducing restricted shares. Following careful consideration,
the Committee decided to retain the key features of the current
policy, and to enhance some components in order to achieve further
simplicity, increase shareholder alignment and reinforce sustained
long-term focus on our strategic priorities. The refreshed policy
ensures continued regulatory compliance and reﬂects evolving best
practice in many areas. The key features of the new policy are:

Currently, if an executive director retires, their LTIP awards vest on a

them with the ﬂexibility to disapply time proration on the vesting of LTIP

Remuneration summary
Variable remuneration awarded to directors in respect of 2018
In 2018, the annual incentive opportunity for executive directors was a maximum of 80 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration. The annual incentive
reﬂects the Group scorecard outcome of 55 per cent of the maximum and the executive director’s personal performance in their respective
areas of responsibility. Executive directors will also receive an LTIP award of 120 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration, subject to three-year RoTE
performance (with a CET1 underpin), relative TSR and a combination of strategic measures focused on the delivery of the strategic priorities.

During 2018, the Committee consulted with shareholders on the
development of the new directors’ remuneration policy and the
performance measures used to determine variable remuneration
outcomes and sought feedback. The proposed policy has been
reﬁned and ﬁnalised taking shareholder feedback into consideration.
In particular, key areas of focus for shareholders were shareholding
requirements, pension contribution levels and the introduction of
discretion to disapply time proration to the vesting of LTIP awards
for retiring executive directors in certain circumstances.
Advice to the Committee
The Committee was assisted in its considerations by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) who were formally
re-appointed by the Committee as its remuneration adviser
in 2017. It is the Committee’s practice to undertake a detailed
review of potential advisers every three to four years.
PwC is a signatory to the voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to
remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC also provides professional
services to the Group in the ordinary course of business including

assurance, advisory, tax advice and certain services relating to
Human Resources. The Committee considered PwC’s role as an
adviser to the Group, and determined that there was no conﬂict or
potential conﬂict arising. The Committee is satisﬁed that the advice
the Committee receives is objective and independent. The total fee
paid to PwC (on an agreed per diem fee basis) was £137,231 which
includes advice to the Committee relating to executive directors’
remuneration and regulatory matters. Management’s advice to the
Committee was also supported by the provision of market data from
PwC (included in the above fee) and from Willis Towers Watson.
The Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer
provided the Committee with regular updates on ﬁnance and risk
matters respectively. The Committee recognises and manages any
conﬂicts of interest when receiving views from executive directors
or senior management on executive remuneration proposals and
no individual is involved in deciding their own remuneration.
Priorities for the Committee in 2019
Speciﬁc priorities for the Committee in 2019, in addition to its usual
scheduled activities, will be to:
¼ Implement the 2019 directors’ remuneration policy for
executive directors
¼ Continue to review the implementation of the Fair Pay Charter and
alignment of workforce policies and practices with the principles
¼ Monitor market trends to ensure the Group’s remuneration
remains competitive, in the context of improving performance
and productivity
¼ Continue to assess the alignment between Group incentives and
a high performance, client focused, innovation culture and the
delivery of the strategy
¼ Ensure compliance with the requirements of the 2018 UK Corporate
Governance Code and the additions to the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations for ﬁnancial years starting on 1 January 2019

This section sets out how the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2016 was applied during 2018 and, together with the section
on 2018 fees for the Group Chairman and independent non-executive directors (INEDs), is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the
2019 AGM. Standard Chartered’s remuneration policy in place for 2018 for executive directors, the Group Chairman and INEDs was

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Annual incentive awards for the executive directors (audited)
Annual incentive awards for all eligible employees are based on the assessment of the Group scorecard, an assessment of individual
performance and, for most employees, an assessment of the performance of their business area or function. The same Group scorecard
is used for the executive directors and other employees.
For Bill Winters and Andy Halford, the Committee considered Group performance, the performance of each of them, and risk, control and
conduct-related matters (with input from Risk and other control functions). The Committee followed a three-step process for determining
annual incentive awards.
1. Consider eligibility: The Committee considered that each director had exhibited an appropriate level of conduct against targets set and
was deemed to have met the gateway requirement to be eligible for an incentive.
2. Evaluate performance against the Group’s scorecard: The Group achieved good ﬁnancial performance during 2018 in challenging
operating conditions, delivering improved income, operating proﬁt and RoE. Speciﬁc strategic achievements included improved client
satisfaction, credit quality and cost savings, growth in digital volumes and signiﬁcant improvements in innovation.

The Committee considered underlying business performance, shareholder returns and current and future risks identiﬁed by the Group’s Principal
Risk Types including operational, conduct, information and cyber security and ﬁnancial crime risks and concluded that annual incentives should
reﬂect a scorecard outcome of 55 per cent. The Committee recognises that share price performance during 2018 was disappointing, and took this
into account when ﬁnalising the overall annual incentive outcomes for the executive directors and other employees.

Notes to the 2018 Group scorecard assessment
1 Total income and operating proﬁt are on an underlying basis. Certain items are presented as restructuring and other items that are excluded from the underlying results of the Group.
These are income, costs and impairment and resulting operating proﬁt relating to identiﬁable business units, products or portfolios from the relevant dates that they have been
approved for restructuring, disposal, wind down or redundancy. This includes realised and unrealised gains and losses from management’s decisions to dispose of assets as well
as residual income, direct costs and impairment of related legacy assets of those identiﬁable business units, products or portfolios. See Note 2 page 246
2 RoE was based on proﬁt attributed to ordinary shareholders, adjusted, on a tax-effected basis, for proﬁts or losses of a capital nature, restructuring charges, amounts consequent to
investment transactions driven by strategic intent and infrequent/exceptional transactions that are signiﬁcant or material in the context of the Group’s normal business earnings for the
period. The CET1 underpin was set at the higher of 12 per cent or the minimum regulatory level as at 31 December 2018 (taking into account any transition rules or material changes in
regulatory rules). Unaudited
3 Funding optimisation was an initiative that targets an efﬁcient level and mix of funding (liabilities) to support the Group’s growth aspirations. Measured in basis points reduction in
funding costs relative to a normalised benchmark, which excludes the impact of interest rate movement, but requires a minimum level of growth in quality funding. Unaudited
4 A maximum/minimum performance threshold was set for each performance measure. The Committee used its judgement to determine scorecard outcomes within this range
(with a higher than 50 per cent outcome for performance above target and a lower than 50 per cent outcome for below target performance)
5 Strategic targets are aligned to internal scorecards measuring in-year progress on multi-year initiatives. Unaudited

3. Assess personal performance and ﬁnalise awards: As outlined in the policy, the Committee can make an upwards or downwards
adjustment to the scorecard outcome for personal performance, consistent with the approach for other employees who were eligible to be
considered for discretionary incentives. When considering whether such an adjustment is appropriate, the Committee considers the particular
areas of responsibility of the executive director together with the objectives that they were asked to prioritise for the year and their personal
contribution to the scorecard outcome. The adjustment will usually be in the range of +/- 10 percentage points to the scorecard outcome.
Bill Winters
The Committee assessed Bill as having outstanding personal performance against his personal objectives during 2018 and in role modelling the
valued behaviours expected by the Board. During 2018, Bill’s leadership has secured the improved performance reﬂected in the scorecard, as
well as broader successes in strengthening the Group’s foundations and in the increased impetus to becoming a simpler, more productive and
more innovative organisation.
Taking this into account, the Committee considered an adjustment of 8 percentage points to be appropriate and determined to award an annual
incentive of 63 per cent of the maximum opportunity. This equates to 50 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration (61 per cent in 2017).

The Committee considered Bill as having role modelled the conduct and behaviour expected by the Board,
setting the very strong tone from the top and the high bar on conduct, which have been instrumental in delivering
the 2018 ﬁnancial and strategic objectives
This is supported by feedback from colleagues across the Group, the leadership team and the Board, showing
that Bill is a very effective, respected and trusted executive leader
During 2018, Bill continued to build on his efforts in 2017 to strengthen the culture across all levels and areas of the
business. He personally led the refresh and launch of our valued behaviours and has devoted considerable time
and effort to embedding these
Bill’s energy and focus has had positive results, with the stronger performance culture evident to the Board, both
in improved performance and in day-to-day operations
Bill personally led initiatives to embed a new approach to problem-solving that increases simplicity and speed in
client processes and injected a new focus on innovation, meeting key objectives set by the Board
During 2018, Bill met his objective to better understand the long-term challenges the Group is facing from external
domains and to put plans in place to turn these into opportunities for longer-term growth. The results of this are
evident in the refreshed strategic priorities
The Committee considered Bill to have delivered against this objective based on regulatory, investor and
client feedback
Bill took signiﬁcant time personally to cultivate and maintain important client relationships

Andy Halford
The Committee assessed Andy as having made a strong personal performance during 2018 against his personal objectives and in
demonstrating the valued behaviours expected by the Board. During 2018 Andy led the successful design of key strategic initiatives for
the Group, improving efﬁciency and productivity. Taking these achievements into account, alongside Andy’s personal contribution to the
scorecard outcome, the Committee considered an adjustment of 5 percentage points to be appropriate and determined to award an
annual incentive of 60 per cent of the maximum opportunity. This equates to 48 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration (61 per cent in 2017).

Long-term incentive plan awards for the executive directors to be granted in 2019
LTIP awards for the 2018 performance year will be granted to Bill and Andy in March 2019 with a value of 120 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration
(£3.3 million and £2.1 million respectively).
Remuneration regulations for European banks mean that dividend equivalent shares are not permitted to be awarded on vesting. The number
of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP will take into account the lack of dividend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus
dividend yield) such that the overall market value of the award is maintained. These awards will vest in ﬁve annual tranches beginning after the
third anniversary of the grant (i.e. March 2022 to March 2026) subject to meeting the performance measures set out below at the end of 2021.
All vested shares are subject to a 12-month retention period.

Performance for 2019–21 LTIP awards will be assessed based on RoTE (with a CET1 underpin), TSR relative to a peer group, and the
achievement of strategic measures. This aligns with the Group moving to reporting RoTE, rather than RoE, as it is a more commonly used
metric. The equal weighting of the measures provides a balanced performance assessment, giving an appropriate focus on execution of the
strategy, investor returns and prudent risk-taking.

Financial statements

The Committee’s starting point for determining performance measures and target levels was to review the ﬁnancial plan and the Group’s
strategic priorities. The Committee also balanced the Group’s current ﬁnancial position and the market environment and outlook with ensuring
the executive directors are incentivised in a challenging yet realistic manner.

capital and liquidity utilisation across the Group
Net interest margins continued to improve in 2018
Andy delivered a material improvement in employee net promoter score, in the culture of inclusion and on female
management diversity metrics for his functions, exceeding the targets set
He has delivered the people development plans across his portfolio, including very good progress in developing
a strong leadership team
The Committee considered Andy to have delivered against this objective based on regulatory and investor
feedback and progress on relevant regulatory matters and transactions

Strategic report

Key objectives

The RoTE target range for 2019–21 LTIP awards is 8 to 11 per cent, which has been set considering the ﬁnancial plan and market outlook.
The equivalent RoE range is broadly 7 to 10 per cent which represents a continued increase in the stretch of our performance targets over
recent years, from an RoE target range of 5 to 8 per cent in the 2017–19 LTIP and from a range of 6 to 9 per cent in the 2018–20 LTIP.

The TSR comparator group for 2019–21 LTIP awards will be the same as for the 2018–20 LTIP and is detailed overleaf. TSR is measured in
sterling for each company and the TSR data averaged over a month at the start and end of the three-year measurement period which starts
from the date of grant.

Supplementary information

The criteria used to select the comparator group for the calculation of the relative TSR performance measure are companies with generally
comparable business activities, size or geographic spread to Standard Chartered or companies with which the Group competes for investor
funds and talent. In aggregate, the comparator group is intended to be representative of the Group’s geographic presence and business
operations. The constituents of the comparator group are reviewed annually, prior to each new LTIP grant.

1 Normalised RoTE is based on proﬁt attributed to ordinary shareholders, adjusted, on a tax-affected basis, for any fair value changes relating to gains/losses on disposals, exceptional
transactions and restructuring gains and losses, expenses and impairments that are signiﬁcant or material in the context of the Group’s normal business for the period, less the
average goodwill and intangibles for the reporting period. Normalised RoTE normally excludes regulatory ﬁnes but, for remuneration purposes, this would be subject to review by
the Remuneration Committee
2 If RoTE reaches 8 per cent then 8.3 per cent of the award vests. If RoTE reaches 11 per cent then 33.3 per cent of the award vests. If RoTE is between the threshold and maximum,
vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points
3 Relative TSR is measured against a comparator group. If the Group’s TSR performance is at least equivalent to the median ranked company then 8.3 per cent of the award vests.
If the Group’s TSR performance is at least equal to the upper quartile ranked company then 33.3 per cent of the award vests. Between these points, the Group’s TSR is compared
to that of the comparators positioned immediately above and below it and straight-line vesting applies

Performance outcomes for 2016–18 long-term incentive plan awards
LTIP awards were granted to Bill and Andy in 2016 with a face value of 200 per cent of ﬁxed remuneration, to reinforce the achievement of the
business turnaround and incentivise the new executive directors. The Committee determined there would be no annual incentives in respect
of 2015 due to the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
The award was share-based and subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance measures over three years. The conduct gateway
requirement must be met before any awards would vest. The awards were then subject to RoE and relative TSR targets and a qualitative
and quantitative assessment of the strategic measures.
The Committee concluded that Bill and Andy exhibited appropriate conduct during the performance period and therefore the conduct
gateway was met. The threshold RoE target has not been achieved and the relative TSR threshold target will be measured in March 2019 but
is estimated not to have been achieved and, therefore, there will be no vesting for the 66.6 per cent of the awards subject to these measures.
The strategic element of the LTIP was designed to measure progress against key elements of the strategic objectives set out for the Group in
2015. The Committee considered performance against the proof points as set out in the table below and determined that in the majority of

100

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Strategic report

cases the targets set had been met or exceeded, with good progress being made in other areas, reﬂecting strong overall performance across
the scorecard. The Committee believes this is consistent with the Group’s very strong overall progress against these strategic objectives over
the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 which is crucial in laying the foundations for future sustainable returns. The Committee
recognises that this has not yet translated into RoE above 7 per cent or shareholder returns above median, and on this basis the Committee
determined that the overall vesting of the LTIP would be 27 per cent.
The awards will vest pro rata over 2019 to 2024 and shares will be subject to a six-month retention period post-vesting. Malus and clawback
provisions apply. The table below summarises the performance measures, targets and performance outcomes.

The LTIP awards granted in May 2016 are due to vest in May 2019, based on performance over the years 2016 to 2018. Following an
estimated assessment of the performance measures (RoE with CET1 underpin, relative TSR and strategic measures), 27 per cent of these
awards will vest. The ﬁnal assessment of relative TSR performance will be conducted in March 2019, the end of the three-year performance
period. Based on a share price of £5.83, the three-month average to 31 December 2018, the estimated value to be delivered is £1,589,000
to Bill and £948,000 to Andy. The ﬁnal value will be restated in the 2019 directors’ remuneration report based on ﬁnal TSR performance
and the share price at vesting. Awards are subject to malus and clawback for up to 10 years from grant. Further details are provided on
pages 100 to 101

The estimated amount of the LTIP award attributable to share price appreciation is calculated based on the total value of the award vesting
minus dividend equivalents minus the face value of the award at the time of grant multiplied by the percentage of the award that vested

For 2017, the LTIP performance measures were not met for awards granted in March 2015, so the awards lapsed for Andy. Bill did not

During 2018, we worked with the Fair Wage Network, a non-governmental organisation, to
develop our understanding of living wages for each of our markets. We then conducted an
analysis of our salary levels against the living wage benchmarks and incorporated living wage
reviews into our 2018 year-end pay decisions
As we expected, salaries in many of our markets are already well above living wage rates.
We will continue to ensure that employees are paid a living wage through our pay review and
hiring processes. Our approach to determining pay at a market competitive level continues
alongside our living wage commitment
For 2019, all employees are paid above a living wage
During 2019, we will conduct a review to assess the potential to incorporate living wages in to
parts of our supply chain, starting with non-employed workers
Global pay guidelines support our hiring teams and people leaders in ensuring an appropriate
balance between salary and bonus opportunity depending on the role and location. We conduct
assurance on this as part of our hiring and pay review processes
We provide core beneﬁts to all employees globally, covering retirement savings, medical
insurance and life assurance, the details of which vary depending on country market practice
Our wellbeing vision is to empower our people through encouraging better living. The beneﬁts
provided under our four wellbeing pillars – mental, physical, social and ﬁnancial – allow us to
provide support to employees at every stage of their lives
During 2018, we aligned our wellbeing provisions to the four pillars, put in place employee
wellbeing champions which now cover 99 per cent of all colleagues, and extended our
Employee Assistance Programme, which provides support and advice to colleagues in times
of need, from 26 countries in 2017 to more than 35 in 2018
2018 was the ﬁrst year that we asked colleagues how they felt about wellbeing support in our
engagement surveys and, globally, 81 per cent of colleagues felt positive
To support our wellbeing pillars we run country speciﬁc and global communication campaigns
on different topics including mental health awareness and ﬁnancial wellbeing
Our global ﬂexible working practices standard ensures that ﬂexible working opportunities are
available to colleagues in all markets and our global standard for parental leave is market-leading
across much of our footprint. In our engagement survey, 76 per cent of colleagues said they
feel supported to work ﬂexibly and we are committed to taking action to continue to improve
this score over time
The launch of the ﬁrst phase of our revised beneﬁts strategy in March 2019 will provide
colleagues in Singapore and the UK with the opportunity to select and adjust beneﬁts to
meet their personal needs, with further countries to follow in later phases. To enable greater
ﬂexibility employees can choose the combination and level of beneﬁts that best meets their
personal needs
Our payroll accuracy is already above 99 per cent and work to automate further our processes
is ongoing, to ensure we can maintain this high standard. When colleagues have questions
about their monthly pay, our HR service desk responds within one day
We continue to focus on ensuring market competitive levels of pay. For all roles at all levels,
we use externally sourced market data to help guide pay decisions, alongside other factors
such as skills and experience, performance, affordability and availability of talent
During 2018, we adjusted our hiring processes in the US, to remove the need for candidates to
share existing compensation data on hiring, to ensure packages are being set with reference
to benchmark data and relevant skills and experience rather than historical pay levels. We will
use our experience of this change to inform thinking on whether we can extend the practice to
additional locations in the future
We are redesigning our beneﬁts offering in a phased approach by location, to bring consistency
to what we offer to all employees based on their role and location, regardless of their seniority
or tenure
For example, in the UK the annual leave entitlement has been harmonised and is now the same
regardless of seniority or tenure

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

We are publishing our ﬁrst Fair Pay Report internally to all colleagues to explain how our performance and reward approach meets the
principles of the Charter, and to provide an update on areas where we are working to enhance our approach. A summary of how we apply
these principles is set out below. We will continue to make progress against our commitments in 2019 and beyond, and a further update will
be included in next year’s report.

During 2018, we took steps to enhance our support for people leaders through the introduction
of the Inclusive Leadership Programme, which is designed to support all people leaders in
understanding the importance of developing an inclusive work environment and equipping
them with skills and capabilities to drive change
We carry out assurance as part of our annual pay review cycle on areas of potential gender
bias in both performance and pay and we have developed analytics to check globally for
equal pay by gender. The outcomes from this review are shared with the Committee and
Management Team
Where available, pay assurance based on diversity characteristics is carried out at a country
level. We recognise that this is a difﬁcult area to assure, and we look to further enhance our
position as we develop new ways of gathering and recording diversity data, where regulations
allow us to do so and where colleagues are happy to provide it
Our approach to determining variable pay is consistent across the Group, and considers
achievement and demonstration of our valued behaviours in support of the high performance
culture we want to embed
In particular, our incentive plans have a clear link to Group and business performance, through
published scorecards, and each individual’s performance including conduct and achievement
against personal objectives is assessed at least annually
The same Group scorecard is used for all colleagues including the executive directors
Each employee has a people leader who supports their performance management, including
setting and reviewing personal objectives, providing advice through regular discussions and
holding structured performance and development conversations at mid-year and year end
We encourage continuous feedback at all levels of the organisation. During 2018, we launched
a new integrated colleague feedback tool, including an app delivered on corporate iPhones and
iPads, which has made it even easier for colleagues to give and request feedback at any time
We send Group communications on pay review outcomes to all colleagues, and feedback is
actively sought through our engagement surveys, including a survey dedicated to employee
experience of the performance and pay review process each March
Our communications explain the principles people leaders use to make salary and variable pay
decisions, helping to ‘demystify’ how pay is determined
Where colleagues do not feel decisions have been made fairly or explained clearly, there are
mechanisms in place to raise and resolve grievances, ranging from support from people leaders,
HR and, if needed, through our formal and conﬁdential Speaking Up programme

Remuneration approach for all employees
Further information on the remuneration approach for different employees is provided in the table below. There may be some country variations
based on statutory requirements and market practice.
Element

Salary

Operation

Alignment between different groups
of employees

¼

Salaries reﬂect the skills and experience of the individual and are reviewed
annually against market information and in the context of the annual
performance assessment and affordability
Increases may occur where there is a role change, increased responsibility
or to ensure market competitiveness
Salaries are typically delivered in cash monthly. For executive directors a
portion of salary is delivered as shares over ﬁve years to enhance alignment
with shareholder interests

¼

Beneﬁts are provided with the details depending on local market practice.
Employees have access to country-speciﬁc, company-funded beneﬁts
such as pension schemes, private medical insurance, permanent health
insurance, life insurance and cash allowances. The cost of providing the
beneﬁts is deﬁned and controlled
Pension and beneﬁt levels differ globally to be competitive in different
markets, and there is no single pension level across the Group
Employees who are relocated or spend a substantial portion of their time
in more than one jurisdiction for business purposes may be provided with
mobility beneﬁts. If employees incur tax charges when travelling overseas
in performance of their duties, these costs may be met by the Group
Sharesave is an all-employee plan where participants are able to open a
savings contract to fund the exercise of an option over shares. The option
price is set at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the share price at the date of
invitation (or such other discount as may be determined by the Committee).
An equivalent cash or share plan is offered in some countries where
Sharesave may not be offered (typically due to tax, regulatory or securities
law issues)

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

¼

Employees are typically eligible to be considered for variable remuneration
Individual incentives are determined with reference to Group, business area
and individual performance considering both what they have achieved and
their demonstration of our valued behaviours
Balanced scorecards are used to assess Group, business and individual
performance. The scorecards include ﬁnancial and strategic measures and
are designed to drive the right outcome for clients while ensuring prudent
risk-taking
Discretionary variable remuneration is delivered in the form of an annual
incentive and, for eligible employees, an LTIP award
Annual incentives are delivered in the form of cash, shares and/or deferred
shares and deferred cash
Typically awarded to senior management, LTIP awards are delivered in
shares and subject to long-term performance measures
The variable remuneration of employees in the Audit, Risk and Compliance
functions is set independently of the business they oversee
Senior management incentives are deferred for up to seven years
When determining levels of variable remuneration, the Group considers the
overall level of performance and risk events in the year
The proportion of variable to ﬁxed remuneration is carefully monitored to
ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
All incentives are subject to the Group’s ex-post risk adjustment of
remuneration policy. This provides the Group with the ability to reduce or
revoke variable remuneration in respect of a risk, control or conduct issue,
event or behaviour

Strategic report

Element

In determining the Group’s total incentives, the Committee used its
judgement to establish the right balance between the performance
of the Group and its ability to attract and retain talent that will drive
the delivery of the Group’s strategy. In 2018, the Committee took into
account Group, business and regional scorecards which were aligned
to the Group’s strategy, a range of risk-adjusted metrics and advice
from both the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Chief Risk
Ofﬁcer on performance. The Committee recognises that share price
performance during 2018 was disappointing and took this into
account when ﬁnalising the overall annual incentive outcomes.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

The Committee determined that total discretionary incentives in 2018
should be $1,179 million. This represents an increase of 3 per cent on
2017 and a reduced ratio of variable compensation to pre-variable
compensation PBT from 28 to 24 per cent, in light of the material
increase in the Group’s underlying proﬁtability in 2018.

Allocation of the Group’s earnings between stakeholders
When considering Group variable remuneration, the Committee takes account of shareholders’ concerns about relative expenditure on pay and
determines the allocation of earnings to expenditure on remuneration carefully, and has approached this allocation in a disciplined way over the
past ﬁve years. The table below shows the distribution of earnings between stakeholders over the past ﬁve years. The amount of corporate tax,
including the bank levy, is included in the table because it is a signiﬁcant payment and illustrates the Group’s contribution through the tax system.

The relationship between the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive and all employees
The Group’s approach to remuneration is consistent for all employees
and is designed to help ensure pay is fair and competitive in line with
our Fair Pay Charter. For the Group Chief Executive and all colleagues:
¼

Externally sourced market data is used to help guide pay decisions

¼

Our incentive plans have a clear link to Group and business
performance, through published scorecards

¼

Each individual’s performance, including conduct and achievement
against personal objectives, is assessed at least annually and drives
incentive decisions

¼

The same Group scorecard is used to determine incentives for
colleagues including the Group Chief Executive

¼

LTIP awards are granted to senior executives who have clear line of
sight to inﬂuence the targets linked to the long-term performance of
the Group

Further details on the approach to Group-wide remuneration and how
we meet the principles set out in our Fair Pay Charter can be found on
pages 103 to 105.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

In our 2017 directors’ remuneration report we voluntarily disclosed
the ratio of the pay of the Group Chief Executive to that of the average
UK employee. We have restated the 2017 ratio following publication
of the calculation methodology by the UK Government in 2018.
Employee pay is calculated to be comparable with the calculation
of the CEO single ﬁgure; this is ‘Option A’ under the reporting
requirements and was selected to take account of investor guidance
stating a preference for this option.
In line with the legislation, the pay ratios have been calculated by
reference to UK employees and the Group Chief Executive’s pay
which has been compared to that of the UK lower quartile, median
and upper quartile employees. We employ more than 85,000 people
in 60 markets around the world with different market rates of pay and
there are varied requirements in the provision and tax treatment of
beneﬁts across different jurisdictions.

Employee pay data is based on full time equivalent pay for UK
employees as at 31 December 2018 and as at 31 December 2017,
for 2018 and 2017 respectively. For each employee, total pay is
calculated in line with the single ﬁgure methodology (i.e. ﬁxed pay
accrued during the ﬁnancial year and the value of performancebased incentive awards vesting in relation to the performance year)

Employee pay data excludes leavers, joiners and employee
transfers in or out of the UK during the year, to help ensure data is
on a like-for-like basis, and data for life assurance and long-term
illness cover are based on the value of notional premia. No other
calculation adjustments or assumptions have been made

¼

CEO pay is as per the single total ﬁgure of remuneration for 2018
and for 2017, as disclosed on page 101

¼

The 2018 ratio will be restated in the 2019 directors’ remuneration
report to take account of the ﬁnal LTIP vesting data for eligible
employees and for the CEO

¼

The Committee has considered the pay data for the three
individuals identiﬁed for 2017 and 2018 and believes that it fairly
reﬂects pay at the relevant quartiles among the UK employee
population. Each of the individuals identiﬁed was a full-time
employee during the year and received remuneration in line with
the Group remuneration policy, and none received exceptional pay

salary plus annual incentive, with all UK employees being eligible to
be considered for an annual incentive based on Group, business and
individual performance.
The year-on-year increase in the pay ratios in the tables below will be
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the increase in the CEO single total ﬁgure of
remuneration which reﬂects the ﬁrst LTIP award vesting to Bill since his
appointment in 2015.

Financial statements

Our long-term incentive plan is intended to link total remuneration to
the achievement of the Group’s long-term strategy and to reinforce
alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interests.
Therefore, participation is typically senior employees who have line
of sight to inﬂuence directly the performance targets on the awards.
The lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees identiﬁed
this year are not participants in the long-term incentive plan. With a
signiﬁcant proportion of the pay of our Group Chief Executive linked
to performance and share price over the longer-term, it is expected
that the ratio will depend materially on long-term incentive outcomes
each year, and accordingly may ﬂuctuate.

Directors’ remuneration
report

Proposed new directors’ remuneration policy
This section sets out the revised directors’ remuneration policy which will be put forward to shareholders at the AGM for a binding vote and,
if approved, will apply from 8 May 2019 for up to three years.
The current remuneration policy for executive directors, the Chairman and independent non-executive directors was approved at the AGM held
on 4 May 2016 and has applied for three years from that date. The policy was well supported by shareholders and continues to support the
delivery of our strategy.
The Board and the Committee conducted a detailed review of the policy in 2018 and considered the views of shareholders, the strategic
objectives of the Group, the remuneration of all colleagues, market benchmarking and best practice. Following careful consideration, the
Committee decided to retain the current policy, and to enhance some components in order to achieve further simplicity, increase shareholder
alignment and reinforce sustained long-term focus on our strategic objectives. Within this framework, several changes are being made which
are summarised in the table opposite. The reﬁnements to the remuneration policy will ensure it continues to reinforce achievement of the
business strategy and shareholder value creation, and promote alignment with colleagues. The refreshed policy ensures continued regulatory
compliance and alignment with evolving best practice in many areas.

Consideration of stakeholder views
The Committee Chair maintains regular contact with the Group’s major shareholders on remuneration and ensures the Committee is informed
of their views. During 2017 and 2018, shareholders representing approximately 70 per cent of our share register were consulted during the
development of the new policy proposals. The shareholder feedback has been considered and reﬂected in the proposed remuneration policy,
with some elements of the policy being changed in response to speciﬁc feedback.
The remuneration of the Group Chairman, executive directors, senior management and all colleagues was considered in the development of the
new policy. The Committee considered the remuneration of the wider workforce to provide greater alignment with Group-wide remuneration
arrangements. The policy is designed to reﬂect the Group’s purpose, valued behaviours and culture ambitions as well as following the principles
of the Fair Pay Charter used to make remuneration decisions for all colleagues in the Group.
When determining pay levels, the Committee takes account of pay increases across the Group, particularly for those employees based in the
UK. Variable pay outcomes are based on Group and business performance, based on measures cascaded from the Group scorecard, and
each individual’s performance is determined based on achievement of their objectives, conduct and valued behaviours.
The Group seeks feedback from all colleagues on remuneration as well as on other workforce policies and practices through a wide range of
mechanisms, including:
¼

Board engagement sessions with colleagues when travelling to our markets

¼

Employee focus groups such as our Employee Representative Groups and our partnerships with our recognised unions and work councils

¼

Feedback from our Group and Country Diversity and Inclusion Councils responsible for promoting diversity and inclusion across the Group

¼

Feedback mechanisms such as Speaking Up where employees can raise concerns in conﬁdence

¼

Biannual engagement surveys of all colleagues on reward, workforce practices and culture and an annual survey dedicated to the employee
experience of the performance and pay review process each March

¼

Forums with our Board and/or with management such as town halls

The key components of the directors’ remuneration policy will be explained to the workforce following the AGM.

The implementation of the policy will be amended to reﬂect the
shareholding requirement as a percentage of total salary and increase
the total requirement to:
¼ Group Chief Executive: 250 per cent of total salary
¼ Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer: 200 per cent of total salary
These result in material ﬁnancial increases of four times the
current requirements for the CEO and three times the current
requirements for the CFO and a move away from a number of

applies to LTIP awards

The structure and operation of the variable element of remuneration
will remain unchanged in the new policy
The Committee considers it appropriate that variable remuneration
is subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions
and with at least 60 per cent subject to performance over the long
term, and with a signiﬁcant proportion of variable pay delivered in
shares over a period of up to seven years plus a further 12-month
retention period, to reinforce alignment of interests with those of our
shareholders and meet regulatory requirements
Alternative variable remuneration structures were considered
as part of the review and it was concluded to retain the current
structure. This follows a rebalancing of variable pay over

Shareholding
requirements

Variable remuneration cannot exceed 200 per cent of
ﬁxed remuneration. It is delivered in two distinct parts,
an annual incentive and an LTIP award:
Annual incentive:
¼ Maximum opportunity of 80 per cent of ﬁxed
remuneration (deﬁned as total salary and pension)
¼ Performance scorecard based on a combination of
ﬁnancial performance and strategic measures and
personal performance, measured over a one-year
period
¼ Delivered as a combination of cash and shares with
a retention period
LTIP award:
¼ Maximum opportunity of 120 per cent of ﬁxed
remuneration (deﬁned as total salary and pension)
¼ Delivered in shares
¼ LTIP vesting is subject to stretching future
performance conditions, measured over at least
three years
¼ Vesting over three to seven years
¼ The delivery of the annual incentive in combination
with the LTIP satisﬁes the regulatory deferral
requirements

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

¼

A simpliﬁed policy, combining salary and FPA into ‘total salary’.
This is to simplify the labelling of ﬁxed pay and reﬂect that total
salary is considered when determining levels of pay for the
executive directors for the size and scope of the role and their
skills and experience
Total salary will be delivered part in cash and part in shares with
the share element being released over ﬁve years with 20 per cent
released each year
For existing directors, pension will be set at 20 per cent of total
salary to meet existing contractual commitments
For new directors, the pension will be 10 per cent of total salary,
which is the same contribution rate for all UK employees

Leaver
provisions

The Committee has the discretion under the relevant
plan rules to determine how eligible leaver status should
be applied on termination, including the ability to award
eligible leaver status in respect of some but not all of an
executive director’s unvested awards.

Typically, when a director leaves, LTIP awards would be prorated
for time served. To reinforce a long-term strategic focus for retiring
executive directors, the Committee will introduce the ﬂexibility to
disapply proration for time not served during the performance period
to the vesting of LTIP awards in certain retirement situations (where
speciﬁc criteria have been met). Following engagement with our
largest shareholders, the criteria below would need to be met as a
minimum before the Committee would consider the disapplication
of proration:
¼ The executive director has more than ﬁve years’ service on
the Board
¼ The executive director is retiring from full-time employment in
ﬁnancial services and comparable roles in other industries
¼ The executive director has demonstrated satisfactory conduct
and has achieved their performance objectives
¼ A clear, Board approved, handover plan is in place to transition
to an identiﬁed successor
If these criteria have been met the Committee would then carefully
consider using its discretion to disapply time proration on a case-bycase basis, which we expect to be rare, taking into account all of the
circumstances at that time. If the ﬂexibility were to be used, typically,
there would be no LTIP award in the ﬁnal year of employment or
additional payments in lieu of ofﬁce. If the individual leaves and
subsequently takes up executive employment unvested awards that
had proration disapplied will lapse and the executive will be expected
to re-pay any vested awards. There will be no change in performance
conditions nor any acceleration of vesting.

Proposed executive directors’ remuneration policy
The proposed executive directors’ remuneration policy, to be effective from the date of the Group’s AGM in May 2019 and beyond, is set out in
the following table.
Fixed remuneration
Element and purpose in supporting the
Group’s strategic objectives

110

Operation

Additional detail including maximum value and
performance measures

Total salary
Support the recruitment and retention of
executive directors, recognising the size
and scope of the role and the individual’s
skills and experience.
Set at a level, together with other ﬁxed
remuneration, that enables the Group to
operate fully ﬂexible variable
remuneration.

¼

Delivered part in cash and part in shares
The share element is subject to a holding
period of ﬁve years, with 20 per cent being
released annually
Reviewed annually with increases generally
applying from April
When determining total salary levels,
consideration is given to the following:
– The size and scope of the role
– The individual’s skills and experience
– Pay at international banks of a similar size
and international scope
– Pay within large UK-listed companies
(including the major UK-listed banks)

¼

Increases may be made at the Committee’s
discretion to take account of circumstances
such as:
– Increase in scope or responsibility
– Increase to reﬂect the individual’s development
in role (e.g. for a new appointment where salary
may be increased over time rather than set
directly at the level of the previous incumbent
or market level)
– Alignment to market-competitive levels
– Consideration to increases given in the context
of salary increases across the Group

Pension
The pension arrangements comprise
part of a competitive remuneration
package and facilitate long-term
retirement savings for directors.

¼

Normally paid as a cash allowance or contribution
to a deﬁned contribution scheme
Pension contributions may also be made in lieu of
any waived salary (and the cash amount of any
annual incentive)

¼

An annual pension allowance or contributions of
up to 20 per cent of total salary are payable to the
executive directors appointed to the Board prior
to 2019
For future directors, an annual pension allowance
or contributions of up to 10 per cent of total salary
will be payable

The maximum value of an annual incentive award
granted to any executive director cannot exceed
80 per cent of that executive director’s ﬁxed
remuneration (deﬁned as total salary and
pension). For this purpose, annual incentive
awards may be valued in line with the relevant
remuneration regulations
Annual incentive awards can be any amount from
zero to the maximum
The determination of an executive director’s
annual incentive is made by the Committee
based on an assessment of a balanced Group
scorecard containing a mix of ﬁnancial and other
long-term strategic measures and personal
performance. Financial measures will comprise at
least 50 per cent of the scorecard. The measures,
individual personal performance weightings and
targets will be set annually by the Committee
The targets, together with an assessment of
performance against those targets, will be
disclosed retrospectively
The Committee will review the scorecard annually
and may vary the measures, weightings and
targets each year
Discretion may be exercised by the Committee to
ensure that the annual incentive outcome is a fair
and accurate reﬂection of business and individual
performance and any risk-related issues (but it will
not exceed the maximum opportunity)

Supplementary information

¼

Annual incentive awards are determined annually
based on Group and individual performance
Annual incentives are delivered as a combination
of cash, shares subject to holding requirements
and deferred shares
Deferral proportions and vesting proﬁles will
be structured so that, in combination with any
LTIP award:
– The proportion of variable remuneration that is
deferred is no less than required by the relevant
remuneration regulations (currently 60 per cent)
– The deferred remuneration vests no faster than
permitted under the relevant remuneration
regulations (currently pro rata over years three
to seven after award)
The Committee can, in speciﬁed circumstances,
apply malus or clawback to all or part of annual
incentive awards. Details on how malus and
clawback operate currently are provided on
page 105
Deferred annual incentive awards will be granted
as conditional share awards or nil-cost options
The Committee may apply discretion to adjust
the vesting of deferred annual incentive awards
and/or the number of shares underlying a
deferred annual incentive award on the
occurrence of corporate events and other
reorganisation events

associated tax incurred in the performance of
their duties. In addition, if executive directors
incur tax charges when travelling overseas in
performance of their duties, these costs will be
met by the Group
Executive directors may from time to time be
accompanied by their spouse or partner to
meetings/events. The costs (and any associated
tax) will be met by the Group

LTIP awards are delivered in shares and may be
subject to holding requirements
Vesting proﬁles are structured so that no LTIP
award vests before the third anniversary of
grant and in combination with any annual
incentive award:
– The proportion of variable remuneration that is
deferred is no less than required by the relevant
remuneration regulations (currently 60 per cent)
– The deferred remuneration vests no faster than
permitted under the relevant remuneration
regulations (currently pro rata over years three
to seven after award)
The Committee can, in speciﬁed circumstances,
apply malus or clawback to all or part of any
LTIP awards. Details on how malus and clawback
operate currently are provided on page 105
LTIP awards will be granted as conditional share
awards or nil-cost options
The Committee may apply discretion to adjust

¼

Executive directors are required to hold a
speciﬁed level of shares, to be built up over
a reasonable timeframe from the date of
appointment as an executive director (or, if later,
from the date of any changes to the terms of the
shareholding requirement)
Shares that count towards the requirement are
beneﬁcially owned shares including the share
element of total salary and vested share awards
subject to a retention period and unvested share
awards for which performance conditions have
been satisﬁed (on a net-of-tax basis)

¼

The shareholding requirement is expressed as a
percentage of total salary and is reviewed by the
Committee on an annual basis

Sharesave is an all-employee plan where
participants (including executive directors) are
able to open a savings contract to fund the
exercise of an option over shares
The option price is set at a discount of up to
20 per cent of the share price at the date of
invitation, or such other discount as may be
determined by the Committee
An equivalent cash or share plan is offered in
some countries where Sharesave may not
be offered (typically due to tax, regulatory or
securities law issues)

The maximum value of an LTIP award granted
to any executive director cannot, in combination
with the annual incentive opportunity in respect
of any particular year, exceed 200 per cent of
that executive director’s ﬁxed remuneration
(deﬁned as total salary and pension)
For this purpose, LTIP awards may be valued in
line with the relevant remuneration regulations
The Committee will, for each year, determine
the split of the overall variable remuneration
opportunity between the LTIP award and annual
incentive opportunity at the start of the year and
disclose this split in advance. The maximum
LTIP award will form at least 120 per cent of
ﬁxed remuneration (i.e. at least 60 per cent of
the maximum variable remuneration opportunity
for any ﬁnancial year), so that the majority of the
variable remuneration opportunity is based on
long-term performance
LTIP awards can be any amount from zero to
the maximum
LTIP awards will be subject to long-term
performance measures, measured over a
period of at least three years
The long-term performance measures may be
a mix of ﬁnancial measures and other long-term
strategic measures. Financial measures will
comprise at least 50 per cent of the performance
measures. Weightings and targets will be set in
advance of each grant by the Committee and
disclosed prospectively, and performance against
those measures will be disclosed retrospectively.
For ﬁnancial measures, vesting will be on a
sliding-scale basis between threshold and
maximum with no more than 25 per cent
vesting at threshold performance

Any new executive director’s remuneration package would include the same elements and be subject to the same variable remuneration
maximums as those for the existing executive directors. The pension provision for new executive directors is 10 per cent of total salary,
consistent with the contribution rate for all UK employees. The policy is summarised below.

The Committee may consider buying out forfeited remuneration and forfeited opportunities and/or compensating
for losses incurred as a result of joining the Group subject to proof of forfeiture or loss
The value of any buy-out award will not exceed, in broad terms, the value of the remuneration forfeited
Any award will be structured within the requirements of the applicable remuneration regulations, and will be no
more generous overall than the remuneration forfeited in terms of the existence of performance measures, timing
of vesting and form of delivery
The value of buy-out awards is not included within the maximum variable remuneration level where it relates to
forfeited remuneration from a previous role or employer

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Strategic report

Remuneration approach on recruitment of an executive director
The Group’s approach to remuneration reﬂects the fact that many of its colleagues bring international experience and expertise and that the
Group recruits from a global marketplace. The Committee’s approach to recruitment is to pay competitive remuneration that reﬂects the Group’s
international nature and enables it to attract and retain key talent.

Notes to the remuneration policy for executive directors

i. Determining whether a leaver is an eligible leaver under the Group’s share plans and treatment of remuneration arrangements
ii. Amending LTIP performance measures following a corporate event to ensure a fair and consistent assessment of performance

Financial statements

Committee’s judgement and discretion
In addition to assessing performance and making judgements on the appropriate levels of annual incentive awards and LTIP awards, the
Committee has certain operational discretions that it may exercise when considering directors’ remuneration, including but not limited to:

iii. Deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award

Supplementary information

Ability for the Committee to amend the policy for emerging and future regulatory requirements
The Committee retains the discretion to make reasonable and proportionate changes to the remuneration policy if the Committee considers this
appropriate in order to respond to changing legal or regulatory requirements or guidelines (including but not limited to any Prudential Regulation
Authority revisions to its remuneration rules and any changes to regulations caused by the UK leaving the European Union). This includes the
ability to make administrative changes to beneﬁt the operation of the remuneration policy and/or to implement such changes ahead of any
formal effective date, ensuring timely compliance. Where proposed changes are considered by the Committee to be material, the Group will
consult its major shareholders and any changes would be formally incorporated into the policy when it is next put to shareholders for approval.

Outside appointments
To encourage self-development

discretion under the relevant
plan rules to determine how
eligible leaver status should be
applied on termination, including
the ability to award eligible leaver
status in respect of some but
not all of an executive director’s
unvested awards.
The current approach is that
eligible leaver status will
generally be given in cases such
as death, disability, retirement
and redundancy. Discretion
is applied as to awarding
eligible leaver status in cases
of mutual separation.
In addition, eligible leaver status
will be given (other than in cases
of termination for cause) where
the date of termination is ﬁve

¼

On a change of control, typically the amount

For eligible leavers, awards not subject to long-term
performance measures vest in full over the original timescale

The Committee has discretion to reduce the level of vesting
Awards subject to long-term performance measures will
typically vest subject to those performance measures and

On a change of control, awards become
exercisable and vest to the extent
performance measures are met (either at the

ﬁnancial services and comparable roles in other industries
– The executive director has demonstrated satisfactory
conduct and has achieved their performance objectives
– A clear, Board-approved, handover plan is in place to

If the ﬂexibility were to be used, typically, there would be no
LTIP award in the ﬁnal year of employment or additional
payments in lieu of ofﬁce
If an individual leaves and subsequently takes up executive
employment, unvested awards that had proration disapplied

Directors’ remuneration
report

2019 policy implementation for executive directors
The structure of remuneration in 2019 will be in line with the new directors’ remuneration policy as detailed on pages 108 to 115 of this report
subject to shareholder approval at the May 2019 AGM. The key elements of remuneration will include total salary (delivered in cash and shares),
pension, beneﬁts, an annual incentive and a long-term incentive plan award.
The Committee reviews the salaries of the executive directors on an annual basis, taking into account, changes to the scope or responsibility of
the role, the individual’s development in the role, and alignment to market-competitive levels. The Committee also takes into account the average
salary increases made to the broader employee population.
For 2019, the Committee determined that an increase to total salary for Bill Winters from £2,300,000 to £2,370,000 (an increase of 3 per cent)
with effect from 1 April 2019 was appropriate. In making the decision, the Committee noted that his ﬁxed remuneration was below that of
some of his global peers, that he had not received a salary increase since his appointment in 2015 and his development in the role since
that time. The Committee also took into account the average salary increase made to the broader employee population since 2015 which
was, on average, 4 per cent each year.
Bill’s pension will continue to be delivered as a contribution to a deﬁned contribution plan and as a cash allowance.
For 2019, the Committee determined that there should be no change to the quantum of ﬁxed remuneration for Andy Halford.
Andy’s pension will continue to be delivered as a cash allowance. The components of Andy’s ﬁxed remuneration will be rebalanced with no
change to the overall quantum that he is contractually entitled to. Total salary will increase by 4 per cent and the proportion of total salary
delivered in cash will increase to offset the 17 per cent reduction in the pension cash allowance. As a result of the rebalancing, the proportion
of total ﬁxed pay delivered in cash will increase by 1 per cent.
Details of ﬁxed remuneration for Bill and Andy are set out below. All ﬁgures are in £000s.

remuneration outcomes for each executive director in four performance scenarios: minimum, on-target, maximum performance and maximum
performance with 50 per cent share price appreciation in line with reporting requirements. The percentages shown in each bar represent the
amount of total remuneration provided by each element of pay.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The measures in the scorecard reinforce the delivery of the refreshed strategic priorities. The targets are set annually by the Committee
and take into account the Group’s annual ﬁnancial plan, the Group strategy and its priorities for the next few years within the context of the
economic environment. The Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests
of the Group to disclose them before the end of the ﬁnancial year. Targets will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report alongside the level of
performance achieved.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

Step 2: Measurement of performance against ﬁnancial and other strategic measures
Financial measures

The Committee reviews the individual performance of each executive director in their areas of personal responsibility. Consistent with the Group’s
treatment of all colleagues, the Committee can make a positive adjustment to the annual incentive if the executive director’s performance is considered
strong and is not fully reﬂected in the scorecard outcome (and vice versa), if appropriate. The Committee will generally consider personal performance
adjustments in the range of up to +/- 10 percentage points on the scorecard outcome.

2 Normalised RoTE is based on proﬁt attributed to ordinary shareholders, adjusted, on a tax-affected basis, for any fair value changes relating to gains/losses on disposals,
exceptional transactions and restructuring gains and losses, expenses, impairments that are signiﬁcant or material in the context of the Group’s normal business for the period,
less the average goodwill and intangibles for the reporting period. Normalised RoTE normally excludes regulatory ﬁnes but, for remuneration purposes, this would be subject to
review by the Committee
3 The CET1 underpin will be dynamically set at the higher of 13 per cent and the minimum regulatory level as at 31 December 2019 (taking into account any transition rules or
material changes in regulatory rules). In addition, the Committee has the discretion to take into account at the end of the performance period any changes in regulatory capital
and risk-weighted asset requirements that might have been announced and implemented after the start of the performance period

Supplementary information

1 Income, costs and impairment and resulting operating proﬁt relating to identiﬁable business units, products or portfolios from the date that have been approved for restructuring,
disposal, wind down or redundancy are presented as restructuring and excluded from the underlying results of the Group. This includes realised and unrealised gains and losses
from management’s decisions to dispose of assets as well as residual income, direct costs and impairment of related legacy assets of those identiﬁable business units, products
or portfolios

4 Initiative that targets an efﬁcient level and mix of funding (liabilities) to support the Group’s growth aspirations. Measured in basis points reduction in funding costs relative to
a normalised benchmark, which excludes the impact of interest rate movement, but requires a minimum level of growth in quality funding

1 The increase in José Viñals’ beneﬁts from 2017 to 2018 is due to the inclusion of the full year beneﬁt of his chauffeur and fees paid for tax services in the 2018 ﬁgure. José Viñals joined
the Group on October 2016 so his 2017 beneﬁts ﬁgure included part-year use of a chauffeur during the 2016/17 tax year
2 The decrease in fees from 2017 to 2018 for Naguib Khejab was due to his change in Board responsibilities. He ceased to be the Senior Independent Director on 1 February 2018
3 Christine Hodgson was appointed Senior Independent Director on 1 February 2018
4 Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala joined the Board on 1 November 2017
5 The decrease in fees from 2017 to 2018 for Jasmine Whitbread was due to the change in her committee responsibilities. Jasmine stepped down from the Board Financial Crime Risk
Committee on 30 September 2017
6 Beneﬁts primarily consist of travel and subsistence costs in relation to Board and Committee meetings and other Board-related events which are taxable in the UK. Partners may also
accompany the directors to meetings. These costs (and any associated tax costs) are paid by the Group. The INEDs’ 2018 beneﬁts ﬁgures shown are in respect of the 2017/18 tax
year. This provides consistency with the reporting of similar beneﬁts in previous years and with those received by executive directors
7 Dr K M Campbell stepped down from the Board on 26 July 2017 and received taxable beneﬁts of £2,346 in respect of the 2017/18 tax year
8 The beneﬁcial interests of directors and connected persons in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out above. The directors do not have any non-beneﬁcial interests in the
Company’s shares. None of the directors used ordinary shares as collateral for any loans. No director had either i) an interest in the Company’s preference shares or loan stocks of
any subsidiary or associated undertaking of the Group or ii) any corporate interests in the Company’s ordinary shares. All ﬁgures are as at 31 December 2018 or on the retirement
of a director unless otherwise stated

Independent non-executive directors’ letters of appointment in 2019
The INEDs have letters of appointment, which are available for inspection at the Group’s registered ofﬁce. Details of the INEDs’ appointments
are set out on pages 57 to 59. INEDs are appointed for a period of one year, unless terminated earlier by either party with three months’ notice.

Fees (audited)
The Board reviewed the fee levels as it does regularly, considering market data and the duties, time commitment and contribution expected.
The last increase to the base fee was in 2009. The Board determined that an increase to the base fee of 5 per cent was appropriate and begins
to reﬂect the signiﬁcant increase in time commitment since 2009. Increases to fees levels for the roles of Remuneration Committee Chair,
Audit Committee member and Risk Committee member were also considered appropriate. The revised fees are set out in the table below:

Executive directors’ shareholdings and share interests including share awards (audited)

In addition to the shareholding requirement, executive directors held a considerable number of ﬁxed pay allowance (FPA) shares which are
released over ﬁve years. Unreleased FPA shares were not counted towards the 2018 shareholding requirements. The levels of unreleased
FPA shares as at 31 December 2018 were: Bill: 249,250; and Andy: 111,079.

Supplementary information

Executive directors are required to hold a certain number of shares, to be built up over a reasonable timeframe from the date of appointment
as an executive director (or, if later, from the date of any change to the terms of the shareholding requirement). Shares that count towards the
requirement are beneﬁcially owned shares including any vested share awards subject only to a retention period. The shareholding requirement
for 2018 was expressed as a number of shares, set as 250,000 shares for the Group Chief Executive and 150,000 shares for the Group Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer. Both Bill Winters and Andy Halford have met their shareholding requirement as outlined below.

1 All ﬁgures are as at 31 December 2018 unless stated otherwise. There were no changes to any executive director’s interests in ordinary shares between 31 December 2018 and
26 February 2019. No director had either (i) an interest in Standard Chartered PLC’s preference shares or loan stocks of any subsidiary or associated undertaking of the Group or
(ii) any corporate interests in Standard Chartered PLC’s ordinary shares
2 The beneﬁcial interests of directors and connected persons in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out above. The executive directors do not have any non-beneﬁcial interests
in the Company’s shares. None of the executive directors used ordinary shares as collateral for any loans

1 For the 2018–20 LTIP awards granted to Bill and Andy on 9 March 2018, the values granted were: Bill Winters: £3.3 million; Andy Halford: £2.1 million. The number of shares awarded
in respect of the LTIP took into account the lack of dividend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield) such that the overall value of the award was
maintained. Performance measures apply to 2018–20 LTIP awards. The share price at grant was the closing price on the day before the grant date
2 On 24 September 2018, restricted share awards vested to Bill over a total of 323,262 shares. The closing share price on the day before vesting was £6.48. On 19 March 2018,
Andy Halford received deferred share awards over a total of 13,195 shares. The closing share price on the day before exercise was £7.67
3 The unvested share awards held by Bill are conditional rights under the 2011 Plan. Bill does not have to pay towards these awards
4 The 2015–17 LTIP awards, deferred shares 2014 and underpin shares 2015–17 held by Andy are nil cost options under the 2011 Plan
5 The 2016–18, 2017–19, and 2018–20 LTIP awards held by Andy are conditional rights under the 2011 Plan. Andy does not have to pay towards these awards 6 The Sharesave
option held by Andy is under the 2013 Sharesave Plan at an exercise price of £5.58 per share
7 Dividend equivalent shares may be awarded on vesting for awards granted prior to 1 January 2018
8 There were no changes to any executive director’s scheme interests in ordinary shares between 31 December 2018 and 26 February 2019

Shareholder dilution
All awards vesting under the Group’s share plans are satisﬁed by the transfer of existing shares or, where appropriate, the issuance of new
shares. The Group’s share plans contain monitored limits that govern both the aggregate amount of awards that may be granted and the
amount of shares that may be issued to satisfy any subsequent exercise of awards. These limits are in line with those stated in the Investment
Association’s Principles of Remuneration and the terms of our listing on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
The Group has two employee beneﬁt trusts that are administered by an independent trustee and which hold ordinary shares to meet various
obligations under the Group’s share plans. As each executive director is within the class of beneﬁciary of these trusts, they are deemed, for the
purposes of the Companies Act 2006, to have an interest in the trusts’ shares.
Details of the trusts’ shareholdings are set out in Note 28 to the
ﬁnancial statements on page 310

The current position on vesting for all unvested LTIP awards from the 2016 and 2017 performance years based on current performance and
share price as at 31 December 2018 is set out in the tables below.

Historical long-term incentive plan awards

1 RoE will be based on proﬁt attributed to ordinary shareholders, adjusted, on a tax-effected basis, for proﬁts or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment
transactions driven by strategic intent and infrequent/exceptional transactions that are signiﬁcant or material in the context of the Group’s normal business earnings for the period.
This includes material one-off changes to valuation methodologies to align with market practice and restructuring charges. RoE would normally exclude regulatory ﬁnes but, for
remuneration purposes, this would be subject to review by the Committee

The comparator group for the TSR measure in the 2017–19 and 2018–20 awards is set out below:

Pillar 3 disclosures on material risk takers’ remuneration and disclosures on the highest-paid employees
Identiﬁcation of material risk takers
The table opposite summarises the groups of employees who have been identiﬁed in accordance with regulatory requirements as material risk
takers for remuneration purposes. Individuals have been identiﬁed as material risk takers in alignment with the qualitative and quantitative criteria
set out in the European Banking Authority’s Regulatory Technical Standard (EU 604/2014 adopted by the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority)
that came into force in June 2014.
Quantitative criteria

The quantitative criteria identify employees who:
¼

Have been awarded total remuneration of EUR500,000 or more in the previous ﬁnancial year

¼

Are within the 0.3 per cent of the number of staff on a global basis who have been awarded the highest total remuneration in the preceding
ﬁnancial year

¼

Were awarded total remuneration in the preceding ﬁnancial year that was equal to or greater than the lowest total remuneration awarded that
year to certain speciﬁed groups of employees

Employees identiﬁed by only the quantitative criteria can be excluded from being identiﬁed as material risk takers if it can be evidenced that they
do not have the ability to have a material impact on the Group’s risk proﬁle.
Qualitative criteria

The qualitative criteria broadly identiﬁes the following employees:
¼

Directors (both executive and non-executive) of Standard Chartered PLC

¼

A member of senior management, which is deﬁned as one or more of the following:
–

A Senior Manager under the Prudential Regulation Authority or Financial Conduct Authority Senior Manager Regime

–

A member of the Group Management Team

¼

Senior management (the level beneath the Management Team)

¼

Senior employees within the audit, compliance, legal and risk functions

¼

Senior employees within material business units

¼

Employees who are members of speciﬁc committees

¼

Employees who are able to initiate or approve credit risk exposures above a certain threshold and sign off on trading book transactions
at or above a speciﬁc value at risk limit

For the purpose of the Pillar 3 tables, unless otherwise stated, senior management is deﬁned as directors of Standard Chartered PLC (both
executive and non-executive), senior managers under the PRA or FCA Senior Manager Regime and members of the Group Management Team.
Material risk takers’ remuneration delivery
Remuneration for material risk takers was delivered in 2018 through a combination of salary, pension, beneﬁts and variable remuneration.
Variable remuneration for material risk takers is structured in line with the PRA and FCA’s remuneration rules. For the 2018 performance year,
the following will apply to variable remuneration awarded to material risk takers in accordance with the regulations:

122

¼

At least 40 per cent of a material risk taker’s variable remuneration will be deferred over a minimum period of three years depending on the
category of material risk taker (see chart on page 123)

¼

Non-deferred variable remuneration will be delivered 50 per cent in shares, subject to a minimum 12-month retention period, and 50 per cent
in cash

¼

At least 50 per cent of deferred variable remuneration will be delivered entirely in shares, subject to a minimum 12-month retention period
(with the exception of deferred shares awarded to risk managers, which are subject to a six-month minimum retention period) in line with
the regulations

¼

For some material risk takers, part of their 2018 variable remuneration may be in share awards which vest after a minimum of three years,
subject to the satisfaction of performance measures

¼

Variable remuneration awards are subject to remuneration adjustment provisions. This provides the Group with the ability to reduce or
revoke variable remuneration in respect of a risk, control or conduct issue, event or behaviour

shares, equivalent to approximately
10 per cent of issued ordinary shares as at
15 March 2018, and up to all of the issued
preference share capital. These authorities
were not used during the year and remained
in force at 31 December 2018.
In accordance with the terms of a waiver

Risk review and Capital review

Subject to company law, the Articles of
Association and the authority granted to
directors in general meeting, the directors
may exercise all the powers of the Company
and may delegate authorities to committees.
The Articles of Association contain provisions
relating to the appointment, re-election and

All directors are nominated for annual
re-election by shareholders subject to
continued satisfactory performance based
upon their annual assessment.

The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant
agreements that would take effect, alter or
terminate following a change of control of the
Company. The Company does not have
agreements with any director or employee
that would provide compensation for loss
of ofﬁce or employment resulting from a
takeover, except that provisions of the
Company’s share schemes and plans may
cause options and awards granted to
employees under such schemes and
plans to vest on a takeover.

There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size
of a holding nor on the transfer of shares,
which are both governed by the general
provisions of the Articles of Association and
prevailing legislation. There are no speciﬁc
restrictions on voting rights and the directors
are not aware of any agreements between
holders of the Company’s shares that
may result in restrictions on the transfer of
securities or on voting rights. No person
has any special rights of control over the
Company’s share capital and all issued
shares are fully paid.

DIRECTORS ’ REPORT

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006,
we have established a process requiring
directors to disclose proposed outside
business interests before any are entered
into. This enables prior assessment of any
conﬂict or potential conﬂict of interest and any
impact on time commitment. On behalf of
the Board, the Governance and Nomination
Committee reviews actual or potential
conﬂicts of interest annually to consider if they
continue to be appropriate, and also to revisit
the terms upon which they were provided.
The Board is satisﬁed that our processes in
this respect continue to operate effectively.

Signiﬁcant agreements

Strategic report

The Company has received from each of
the independent non-executive directors
an annual conﬁrmation of independence
pursuant to Rule 3.13 of the HK Listing Rules
and still considers all of the non-executive
directors to be independent.

Details of transactions with directors and

in Note 36 on page 328.

Connected/continuing
connected transactions
By virtue of its shareholding of over
10 per cent in the Company, Temasek and its
associates are related parties and connected
persons of the Company for the purposes of
the UK Listing Rules and the Listing Rules of
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited
(the HK Listing Rules) respectively (together
‘the Rules’).
The Rules are intended to ensure that there
is no favourable treatment to Temasek or
its associates to the detriment of other
shareholders in the Company. Unless
transactions between the Group and
Temasek or its associates are speciﬁcally
exempt under the Rules or are subject
to a speciﬁc waiver, they may require a
combination of announcements, reporting
and independent shareholders’ approval.
On 19 October 2015, the HKSE extended
a waiver (‘the 2015 Waiver’) it previously
granted to the Company for the revenue
banking transactions with Temasek which do
not fall under the passive investor exemption
(the Passive Investor Exemption) under
Rules 14A.99 and 14A.100. Under the 2015
Waiver, the HKSE agreed to waive the
announcement requirement, the requirement

vote at any general meeting.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

to enter into a written agreement and set an
annual cap and the reporting (including
annual review) requirements under Chapter
14A for the three-year period ending
31 December 2018 on the conditions that:
a) The Company will disclose details of
the 2015 Waiver (including nature of
the revenue banking transactions with
Temasek and reasons for the 2015 Waiver)
in subsequent annual reports
b) The Company will continue to monitor
the revenue banking transactions with
Temasek during the three years ending
31 December 2018 to ensure that the
5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio
will not be exceeded
The main reasons for seeking the 2015
Waiver were:
¼

¼

The nature and terms of revenue banking
transactions may vary and evolve over
time; having ﬁxed-term written agreements
would not be suitable to accommodate the
various banking needs of the Company’s
customers (including Temasek) and would
be impractical and unduly burdensome
It would be impracticable to estimate and
determine an annual cap on the revenue
banking transactions with Temasek as
the volume and aggregate value of each
transaction are uncertain and unknown
to the Company as a banking group
due to multiple factors including market
driven factors

¼

The revenues generated from revenue
banking transactions were insigniﬁcant.
Without a waiver from the HKSE or an
applicable exemption, these transactions
would be subject to various percentage
ratio tests which cater for different types
of connected transactions and as such
may produce anomalous results

For the year ended 31 December 2018, the
Group provided Temasek with money market
placement products and services that were
revenue transactions in nature.
As a result of the Passive Investor Exemption
and the 2015 Waiver, the vast majority of the
Company’s transactions with Temasek and
its associates fall outside of the connected
transactions regime. However, non-revenue
transactions with Temasek or any of its
associates continue to be subject to
monitoring for connected transaction issues.
The Company conﬁrms that:
¼

The revenue banking transactions entered
into with Temasek in 2018 were below the
5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio
test under the HK Listing Rules

The Company therefore satisﬁed the
conditions of the 2015 Waiver.
On 27 December 2018, the HKSE extended
the 2015 Waiver for another three years
ending 31 December 2021 (‘the 2018
Waiver’). Further details of the 2018 Waiver
will be disclosed in subsequent annual
reports. The Company will continue to
monitor the revenue banking transactions

Risk management

Internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining and
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal
control system. The effectiveness of our
internal control system is reviewed regularly
by the Board, its committees, the
Management Team and Group Internal Audit.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal control during the year ended
31 December 2018. The Committee’s review
was supported by an annual business
self-certiﬁcation process, which was
managed by Group Internal Audit. Group
Internal Audit monitors compliance with
policies and standards and the effectiveness

The Bridge is supported by Group, local and
business newsletters, targeted audio calls,
videos, success story bulletins, town halls
and engagement events including brown
bag lunches, leadership events, regional
meetings, and focus groups. Business or
time-critical information is sent directly to
our people’s inboxes through a measurable
email platform.
Our senior leaders and People Leaders
continue to have a critical role to play in
engaging our people, ensuring that they are
kept up to date on key business information,
our performance and strategy, their role in
executing the strategy and ensuring that
they consult and listen to their teams’
views, feedback and concerns. Across the
organisation, team meetings with People
Leaders, one-to-one discussions, and
management meetings enable our people to
discuss and clarify anything they have heard
or read and address any questions they may
have. The individual performance reviews
also provide the opportunity to discuss how
individuals, the team and the business area
contributed to our overall performance and
how any compensation awards relate to this.
This mix of channels ensures that all our
colleagues receive relevant information
promptly regardless of how they prefer to
be communicated with and regardless of
where they sit in the organisation.

Supplementary information

In accordance with Article 435(e) of the
Capital Requirements Regulation, the Board
Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board,
has considered the adequacy of the risk
management arrangements of the Group
and has sought and received assurance that
the risk management systems in place are
adequate with regard to the Group’s proﬁle
and strategy.

Our business is conducted within a
developed control framework, underpinned
by policy statements, written procedures and
control manuals. There are written policies
and procedures designed to ensure the
identiﬁcation and management of risk,
including credit risk, country risk, traded risk,
capital and liquidity risk, operational risk,
reputational risk, compliance risk, conduct
risk, information and cyber security risk
and ﬁnancial crime risk. The Board has
established a management structure that
clearly deﬁnes roles, responsibilities and
reporting lines. Delegated authorities are
documented and communicated. Executive
risk committees regularly review the Group’s
risk proﬁle. The performance of the Group’s
businesses is reported regularly to senior
management and the Board. Performance
trends and forecasts, as well as actual
performance against budgets and prior
periods, are monitored closely. Financial
information is prepared using appropriate
accounting policies, which are applied
consistently. Operational procedures and
controls have been established to facilitate
complete, accurate and timely processing
of transactions and the safeguarding of
assets. These controls include appropriate
segregation of duties, the regular
reconciliation of accounts and the valuation of
assets and positions. In respect of handling
inside information, we have applied relevant
controls on employees who are subject to
handling inside information, including controls
over the dissemination of such information
and their dealings in the Company’s shares.
Such systems are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.

The primary channel for communicating
with our colleagues continues to be the
Bridge – our business collaboration platform.
The Bridge provides global, local, business
and function communications and allows
our people to collaborate, exchange ideas,
feedback, comment, innovate, communicate,
and ﬁnd experts all through one space,
wherever they are located.

We work hard to ensure that our colleagues
are kept informed about matters affecting
or of interest to them, but more importantly
to provide opportunities for feedback
and dialogue. We have a clear set of
communications mechanisms that are used
to inform colleagues of key business activity
at a global, regional, business and function
level. We continue to evolve and develop our
internal communications following feedback
from colleagues. We continue to listen to
ensure internal communications remain
impactful, meaningful and support the
Group’s strategy and transformation.

Risk review and Capital review

The Board is responsible for maintaining and
reviewing the effectiveness of the risk
management system. An ongoing process
for identifying, evaluating and managing
the signiﬁcant risks that we face is in place.
The Board is satisﬁed that this process
constitutes a robust assessment of all of
the principal risks and uncertainties facing
the Group, including those that would
threaten its business model, future
performance, solvency or liquidity.

an important way for us to gather feedback
on how our colleagues feel about the
organisation, the challenges we are facing
and how we can make the Group a better
place to work. More information on the
engagement survey and its results can be
found within the Colleagues section of the
Strategic Report.
We seek to build productive and enduring
partnerships with various employee
representative bodies (including unions
and work councils). In our recognition and
interactions, we are heavily inﬂuenced by
1948 United Nations Universal Declaration
of Human Rights (UDHR), and several
International Labour Organisation (ILO)
conventions including the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949
(No. 98) and the Freedom of Association
and Protection of the Right to Organise
Convention, 1948 (No. 87). Additionally,
we abide by all local country labour laws
and acts that protect employees’ rights
to organise.
In June 2018, we integrated the components
of our Group Equal Opportunities, Diversity,
Inclusion and Dignity at Work Policy into our
Group Code of Conduct. Everyone who
works at Standard Chartered is bound
by the Code, whether they are full-time,
ﬁxed term, a director, a contractor, a
subcontractor, a secondee, a temporary
employee or a voluntary worker, working in
any subcontracted company and in any
capacity. The Group Code of Conduct is well
understood throughout the Group, supported
by signiﬁcant Group communication, and this
is evident through our last My Voice Survey
results where 96 per cent of colleagues
responded saying that they understood
what the Group Code of Conduct meant
for them in their role.
Holistically, the Group Code of Conduct
reinforces our commitment to providing
equality of opportunity and fair treatment in
employment. We do not accept unlawful
discrimination in our recruitment and
employment practices, terms, procedures,
processes and decisions on any grounds
including but not limited to: sex, gender,
nationality, ethnicity, race, colour, native or
indigenous origin, disability, age, marital
or civil partner status, pregnancy and
maternity, sexual orientation, gender identity,
expression or reassignment, HIV or AIDS
status, parental status, employment status,
military and veteran status ﬂexibility of
working arrangements, religion, or belief.
The Group will strive for recruitment,
employment, redundancy and redeployment
training, development, succession planning
and promotion practices that are free of
barriers, both systemic and deliberate, and
do not directly or indirectly discriminate.

130

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Recruitment, employment, training,
development and promotion decisions are
based on existing skills, knowledge and
behaviour required to perform the role to the
Group’s standards. Implied in all terms is the
commitment to equal pay for equal work.
Employees are rewarded in a way that is free
from discrimination. Their potential, conduct
and valued behaviours should be considered
as set out in the Fair Pay Charter.
The Group aims to be a disability conﬁdent
organisation with a focus on removing
barriers and increasing accessibility. The
Group shall make reasonable workplace
adjustments, including for disabilities and
religious practices. If colleagues become
disabled, efforts are made to ensure their
employment continues, with appropriate
training and workplace adjustments where
necessary. This is supported by the Global
Guideline and Process for Workplace
Adjustment that was re-launched in 2016
to support colleagues with disabilities.
The Group’s approach to misconduct issues
(including dismissals) is guided by the Fair
Accountability principles which endorse
thoughtful judgement, proportionality,
procedural appropriateness and fairness of
outcomes. Dismissals because misconduct
issues and performance (where required
by law to follow a disciplinary process) are
governed by the Group Disciplinary Policy
and Procedure with clear standards.
Where local law or regulation requires a
different process with regards to dismissals
and other disciplinary actions, country
procedures vary accordingly to account
for local law and regulation.
The Group has a Flexible Working Practices
Policy which was rolled out in 2017, allowing
colleagues a range of ﬂexible working
options– this includes ﬂexible time, working
from home or part-time working. Our global
Parental Leave Beneﬁts were also revised in
2017, to support working parents no matter
where they are across the Group. We now
provide a minimum of 20 calendar weeks
fully paid maternity leave, a minimum of
leave of two calendar weeks for spouses
or partners, and two calendar weeks for
adoption leave. Combined, this places
the Group above the International Labour
Organisation minimum standards.

Health and safety
Our Health and Safety (H&S) programme
covers both mental and physical wellbeing.
The Group complies with both external
regulatory requirements and internal policy
and standards for H&S in all markets. It is
Group policy to ensure that the more
stringent of the two requirements is always
met, ensuring our H&S practices meet
or exceed the regulatory minimum.

Compliance rates are reported quarterly to
each country’s management team. Based
on our risk proﬁle, our H&S standards deﬁne
our requirements for H&S governance and
assurance, workstation ergonomics, ﬁre
safety, ﬁrst aid, indoor air quality and the
work environment, vehicle and driving safety,
incident reporting and investigation, and
accessible design.

Major customers
Our ﬁve-largest customers together
accounted for 1.8 per cent of our total
operating income in the year ended
31 December 2018.

Major Suppliers
Our ﬁve largest suppliers together accounted
for less than 15 per cent of purchases in the
year ended 31 December 2018.

Supply chain management
For information about how the Group
engages with suppliers on environmental
and social matters, please see our Supplier
Charter. As set out under the UK Modern
Slavery Act 2015, the Group is required to
publish a Modern Slavery Statement annually.
The Group’s 2018 Modern Slavery Statement
will be issued in line with the Annual Report
and Accounts. This document will give further
detail on how the Group has managed social
risks in its supply chain during 2018.

Product responsibility
We design and offer products and services
based on an understanding of our client
needs and best interests; we aim to treat
our clients fairly at all times; we protect client
privacy; we manage potential conﬂicts of
interest, and we seek and use client feedback
and complaints to improve our products.
The Group has in place policies and
procedures to ensure products and services
are sold to suitable target markets, deliver fair
outcomes to clients, and comply with relevant
laws and regulations.

Group Code of Conduct
The Board has adopted a Group Code of
Conduct (the Code) relating to the lawful
and ethical conduct of business and this
is supported by the Group’s core values.
It has been communicated to all directors
and employees, all of whom are expected to
observe high standards of integrity and fair
dealing in relation to customers, employees
and regulators in the communities in
which the Group operates. Directors and
employees are asked to recommit to the
Code annually, and this was done during
September 2018.

For more information, review the reporting criteria at
sc.com/environmentcriteria

We report on all emission sources required
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic
Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations.
Using conversion factors from the
International Energy Agency 2018 Emissions
Factors and the UK Government’s 2018 GHG
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting,
emissions are reported in metric tonnes of
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e),
encompassing the six Kyoto gases.

Scope 1
Scope 1 emissions are deﬁned as arising
from the consumption of energy from direct
sources, such as by burning diesel within
generators, during the use of property
occupied by the Group.
Scope 2
Scope 2 emissions are deﬁned as arising
from the consumption of indirect sources of
energy, such as consumption of purchased
electricity and heat, during the use of
property occupied by the Group.
Despite the amendment issued to the
GHG Protocol in 2015, we report Scope 2
emissions under location-based methods
and have decided not to use market-based

Scope 3
Scope 3 emissions are deﬁned as occurring
as a consequence of the Group’s activities,
but arising from sources not controlled by us.
The Group currently reports on Scope 3
emissions arising from air travel and our
outsourced data centres globally.

Reporting period
The reporting period of our environmental
data is from 1 October 2017 to 30 September
2018. This allows sufﬁcient time for
independent assurance to be gained prior
to the publication of results. Accordingly,
the operating income used in this inventory
corresponds to the same time period
rather than the calendar year used in
ﬁnancial reporting.

Assurance
Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are assured
by an independent body, The Carbon Trust,
against the requirements of ISO14064.

Managing environmental
and social risk

high standards of responsible business are
maintained and that an effective control

The Board receives information to identify
and assess signiﬁcant risks and opportunities
arising from environmental and social
matters, including climate change. These
issues are overseen by the Brand, Values
and Conduct Committee. The Committee
reviews sustainability priorities, and oversees
the development of, and delivery against,
public commitments regarding the activities
and/or businesses that the Group will or will
not accept in alignment with our Here for

In addition, the Group Head, Corporate

is no alternative in terms of quality and there
is no conﬂict with their duties as auditor.
KPMG can be used where the statutory
auditor is required to be used due to
regulatory or legal requirements.
The policy clearly sets out the criteria for
when the Audit Committee’s prior written
approval is required. The policy requires a
conservative approach to be taken to the
assessment of requests for KPMG to provide
non-audit services. Subject to the overriding
principle, the Audit Committee’s view is that
KPMG can be of value in a range of non-audit
service activities and should be allowed to
tender subject to the terms of the policy.
The Group is required to take a conservative
approach to interpreting the potential threats
to auditor independence and requires
commensurately robust safeguards
against them.
EU legislation and guidance from the
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) sets out
threats to audit independence including
self-interest, self-review, familiarity, taking
of a management role or conducting
advocacy. In particular, maintaining KPMG’s
independence from the Group requires
KPMG to avoid taking decisions on the
Group’s behalf. It is also recognised as
essential that management retains the
decision-making capability as to whether to
act on advice given by KPMG as part of a
non-audit service. This means not just the
ability to action the advice given, but to have
sufﬁcient knowledge of the subject matter to
be able to make a reasoned and independent
judgement as to its validity. All of this is
contained within the policy.
By way of (non-exhaustive) illustration of the
application of the principles set out in the
policy, the following types of non-audit
services are likely to be permissible under
the policy:
¼

Audit-related services – the Group
would also extend this to work on
investor circulars in most foreseeable
circumstances

¼

An objective view as to whether the
Group has applied external laws and
regulations appropriately, such as
checks over regulatory compliance

¼

Internal control review services

¼

Due diligence over potential purchases
or sales

Standard Chartered

¼

The policy is not a prescribed list of
non-audit services that KPMG is permitted
to provide. Rather, each request for
KPMG to provide non-audit services will
be assessed on its own merits. The Audit
Committee believes that such a case-bycase approach best accommodates (i)
the need for the appropriate rigour and

while (ii) preserving sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for
the Group to engage KPMG to provide
non-audit services where they are able
to deliver particular value to the Group
and where the proposed services can be
provided without compromising KPMG’s
objectivity and independence.

There is a cap on non-audit services
provided by KPMG and such fees cannot
exceed 70 per cent of the average Group
audit fee from the previous three consecutive
ﬁnancial years, excluding audit related
non-audit services and services carried out
pursuant to legislation. For 2018 the ratio
was 2 per cent. Details relating to KPMG’s
remuneration as the Group statutory auditor
and a description of the broad categories of
the types of non-audit services provided by
KPMG are given in Note 38 on page 329.

Auditor
The Audit Committee reviews the
appointment of the Group statutory auditor,
its effectiveness and its relationship with the
Group, which includes monitoring our use of
the auditors for non-audit services and the
balance of audit and non-audit fees paid.
Following a review of the independence and
effectiveness of our Group statutory auditor
(details of which can be found on page 74),
resolutions to appoint KPMG and to
determine its remuneration will be proposed
at the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
Each director believes that there is no
relevant information of which our Group
statutory auditor is unaware. Each has taken
all steps necessary as a director to be aware
of any relevant audit information and to
establish that KPMG is made aware of any
pertinent information.

Risk update

Risk update
All risk types, both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial, are managed and reported in accordance
with the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework. 2018 saw sustained progress
towards improving the resilience of the Group’s portfolios as shown here by the key
highlights from the past year.

2018 Key highlights
¼

Lower credit impairment in the ongoing
book – 38 per cent reduction on levels
seen in 2017

¼

Improved credit quality of the Corporate
portfolios

¼

Further strengthening of our
capital position

Our portfolio quality
Our core objective is to build a strong
and sustainable business and in 2018 we
made progress towards this end. We have
secured the foundations of the Group,
having overseen a continued reduction in
credit impairment, and show resilience as
evidenced by strong capital and liquidity
metrics. Our Risk Appetite Statement is

approved by the Board and is set to enable
us to grow sustainably while avoiding shocks
to earnings or our general ﬁnancial health,
and to manage our Reputational Risk in a
way that would not materially undermine the
conﬁdence of our investors and all internal
and external stakeholders. In 2018, we
added further granularity to our Risk Appetite,
including cascading critical Risk Appetite
metrics down to countries with signiﬁcant
business operations. The Group will not
compromise adherence to its Risk Appetite
to pursue revenue growth or higher returns.
Credit quality has continued to improve in
2018, as the positive momentum from the
previous year was carried over in many
important areas. We further reduced our
liquidation portfolio by 39 per cent to
$1.4 billion at the end of 2018 (2017:
$2.2 billion) through active management, with
net loans and advances of $0.3 billion (2017:
$0.7 billion), after provisions. From 2019, the

Group will report the liquidation portfolio as
part of its underlying business. Credit grade
12 balances were ﬂat year-on-year, while
we observed a decrease in net exposure
on early alert from $8.7 billion to $4.8 billion,
mainly due to reductions in counterparty
exposure and accounts being regularised.
The percentage of investment grade clients
in our corporate net exposure increased to
62 per cent (2017: 57 per cent), and new
origination is carried out within Risk Appetite.
We remain alert to broader geopolitical
uncertainties that have affected sentiment
in some of our markets, and we continue
to focus on early identiﬁcation of emerging
risks across all our portfolios to proactively
manage any areas of potential weakness.
The Group continues to be well diversiﬁed,
across industry sectors, products and
geographies, and exposures remain
predominantly short tenor. The Group
remains selective in cyclical sectors such

Annual Report 2018

Stage 3/Non-performing loans
Overall gross credit-impaired (stage 3) loans
for the Group reduced by 21 per cent in
2018, from $8.8 billion to $6.9 billion, as
planned reductions in the liquidation
portfolio were combined with decreases
in the ongoing business.
Gross credit-impaired (stage 3) loans for the
ongoing business decreased from $6.5 billion
to $5.6 billion in 2018, mainly driven by
repayments and write-offs in Corporate &
Institutional Banking. There was also a large
reduction in inﬂows to stage 3 in Corporate
& Institutional Banking as historically high
inﬂows in India and the oil and gas sector did
not recur, offset by an increase in inﬂows to
stage 3 in Commercial Banking exposures
in Greater China & North Asia and Africa
& Middle East, with no speciﬁc industry
concentration. Most of these new stage 3
counterparties had been on early alert prior
to transfer to stage 3 and do not indicate new
areas of stress for the overall portfolio.

Credit impairment for the Corporate &
Institutional Banking ongoing business is
signiﬁcantly lower at 35 per cent of the
levels seen last year (2018: $229 million;
2017: $657 million). This reﬂected an
improvement in the risk proﬁle in this
segment, and continued focus on highquality new origination.
Commercial Banking ongoing business credit
impairment increased by 45 per cent (2018:
$244 million, 2017: $168 million) compared to
2017, which saw a release of $63 million of
portfolio impairment provisions held against
certain sectors of the portfolios that were
no longer required. Africa & Middle East
contributed 60 per cent of the full-year
2018 charge.
Retail Banking credit impairment was
29 per cent lower in the year (2018:
$267 million, 2017: $374 million) driven by
portfolio improvements, run down of highrisk segments in our unsecured portfolios
and one-off provision releases in Korea
and Indonesia.
Credit impairment in the restructuring
portfolio was $(87) million (2017: $162 million),
and includes the net release of $79 million in
the liquidation portfolio due to loan disposals
and repayments.

At a Group level, total credit impairment
including the liquidation and restructuring
portfolio is $0.7 billion, representing a loan
loss rate of 21 basis points (bps) of average
customer loans and advances. This was
signiﬁcantly lower than the levels observed
in 2017 ($1.4 billion) and 2016 ($2.8 billion).
Credit impairment for the ongoing business
reduced by 38 per cent to $0.7 billion
(2017: $1.2 billion), representing a loan loss
rate of 24 basis points of average customer
loans and advances, driven by improvements
in Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Retail Banking.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

The Group maintains a strong liquidity
position, with the liquidity coverage ratio
higher at 154 per cent from 146 per cent in
2017. This was driven by an increase in our
liquid asset position partially aligned to the
growth in our overall balance sheet as we
continued to focus on high-quality liquidity
across our businesses. The advancesto-deposits ratio (2018: 64.9 per cent)
decreased from the previous year (2017:
67.0 per cent). We remain a net provider
of liquidity to the interbank markets and
our customer deposit base is diversiﬁed by
type and maturity. We have a substantial
portfolio of marketable securities which can
be realised in the event of a liquidity stress
situation. The Group’s Common Equity Tier 1
ratio of 14.2 per cent was 60 basis points
higher than 2017 mainly due to a lower level

The average level of total trading and
non-trading value at risk (VaR) in 2018 was
$20.6 million, 20 per cent lower than in 2017,
driven by a reduction in the duration of the
non-trading portfolio in the ﬁrst half of 2018.
However, by year end 2018, the non-trading
VaR had risen because of an increase in the
portfolio inventory and reduced portfolio
diversiﬁcation in the second half of the year.

including collateral increased to 87 per cent
(1 January 2018: 84 per cent). The cover
ratio for Retail Banking remained stable at
48 per cent, and the cover ratio including
collateral improved to 87 per cent (1 January
2018: 74 per cent).

Directors’ report

In Retail Banking and Private Banking, loans
and advances were broadly stable, with
exposures mainly in Greater China & North
Asia and ASEAN & South Asia. Secured
lending remains the primary focus of our
Retail Banking business, with 84 per cent of
the book continuing to be fully secured as of
the end of 2018. The average loan-to-value of
the mortgage portfolio is low at 45 per cent
(2017: 47 per cent). Retail Banking overall
delinquencies remained stable with early
delinquent buckets in stage 2 reducing to

$21.5 billion. This was driven by a reduction

as commodity traders, oil and gas support,
and metals and mining. There was an
increase in the net exposure to our top 20
corporate clients as a percentage of Tier 1
Capital (2018: 54 per cent; 2017: 50 per cent),
mainly in investment grade global majors.
The largest sector concentrations within
the Corporate & Institutional Banking
and Commercial Banking portfolios are
manufacturing, at 17 per cent of loans and
advances to customers (2017: 16 per cent)
and ﬁnancing, insurance and non-banking
ﬁnancial counterparties, which remains
at 15 per cent. All other industry
concentrations are at or below 12 per cent.
The proportion of long-term sub-investment
grade exposure for which we are
collateralised remains above 50 per cent.
This has us well positioned to realise new
opportunities, while remaining vigilant for
any new threats that may arise and working
on areas that need improvement.

Risk proﬁle

Risk proﬁle
Our risk proﬁle in 2018
Through our well-established risk governance
structure and Enterprise Risk Management
Framework (ERMF), we closely manage
our risks with the objective of maximising
risk-adjusted returns while remaining in
compliance with the Risk Appetite Statement.
We manage uncertainties through a dynamic
risk scanning process that provides a
forward-looking view of the economic,

business and credit conditions across
the Group’s key markets, enabling us to
proactively manage our portfolio.
We continue to reposition the Group’s
corporate portfolio, exiting weaker credit
or lower-returning clients and adding new
clients selectively. We remain alert to broader
geopolitical uncertainties that have affected
sentiment in some of our markets, and we
continue to focus on early identiﬁcation of

emerging risks across all our portfolios to
manage any areas of potential weakness
on a proactive basis. The Group’s portfolio
is well diversiﬁed across dimensions such
as industries, geographies and products.

Basis of preparation
Unless otherwise stated, the balance sheet
and income statement information presented
within this section is based on the Group’s
management view. This is principally the
location from which a client relationship is
managed, which may differ from where it
is ﬁnancially booked and may be shared
between businesses and/or regions.
This view reﬂects how the client segments
and regions are managed internally.

Loans and advances to customers and
banks held at amortised cost in this Risk
proﬁle section include reverse repurchase
agreement balances held at amortised
cost, per Note 16 Reverse repurchase and
repurchase agreements including other
similar secured lending and borrowing.

IFRS 9 changes and methodology
IFRS 9 came into effect on 1 January 2018.
As a summary the primary changes for the
Group are as follows:
New impairment model
IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model
that requires the recognition of expected
credit losses (ECL) rather than incurred
losses under IAS 39 on all ﬁnancial debt
instruments held at amortised cost, fair
value through other comprehensive income
(FVOCI), undrawn loan commitments and
ﬁnancial guarantees.

Staging of ﬁnancial instruments
Financial instruments that are not already
credit-impaired are originated into stage 1
and a 12-month expected credit loss
provision is recognised.
Instruments will remain in stage 1 until they
are repaid, unless they experience signiﬁcant
credit deterioration (stage 2) or they become
credit-impaired (stage 3).
Instruments will transfer to stage 2 and a
lifetime expected credit loss provision
recognised when there has been a signiﬁcant
change in the credit risk compared with what
was expected at origination.
The framework used to determine a
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk is set out
below (page 142).
Instruments are classiﬁed as stage 3 when
they become credit-impaired.

Where relevant, the 1 January 2018 balance
sheet has been used for comparative
purposes. The Group’s initial estimate of
credit impairment on adoption of IFRS 9
was $6,720 million. Following reﬁnement

of the Group’s expected loss models, the
estimate of the opening credit impairment
was revised down by $222 million to
$6,498 million, and the net expected credit
loss of $(1,296) million adjusted against
retained earnings was similarly decreased
by $222 million to $(1,074) million. This was
presented as part of the Group’s 2018 interim
ﬁnancial statements.
A summary of the differences between
IFRS 9 and IAS 39 is disclosed in Note 41
IFRS 9 Financial instruments.

IFRS 9 changes and methodology
The accounting policies under IFRS 9 are set
out in Note 8 Credit impairment and Note 13
Financial instruments. The impact upon
adoption of IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018
is set out in Note 41 IFRS 9 Financial
instruments. The main methodology
principles and approach adopted by the
Group are set out in the following table with
cross references to other sections.

Description

Approach to
determining
expected
credit losses

For material loan portfolios, the Group has adopted a statistical modelling
approach for determining expected credit losses that makes extensive use of
credit modelling. Where available, the Group has leveraged existing advanced
Internal Ratings Based (IRB) regulatory models that have been used to
determine regulatory expected loss.

Title

Financial statements

The Group has not restated comparative
information. Accordingly, amounts prior to
1 January 2018 are prepared and disclosed
on an IAS 39 basis. This primarily impacts
the credit risk disclosures, where loan loss
provisioning is determined on an expected
credit loss basis under IFRS 9 compared with
an incurred credit loss basis under IAS 39.

Credit risk overview
Credit risk is the potential for loss due to
the failure of a counterparty to meet its
obligations to pay the Group. Credit

Title

Risk proﬁle

Description

Expected credit loss for ﬁnancial assets will transfer from a 12-month basis to a
Signiﬁcant
increase in credit lifetime basis when there is a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk (SICR) relative to
that which was expected at the time of origination, or when the asset becomes
risk (SICR)
credit-impaired. On transfer to a lifetime basis, the expected credit loss for those
assets will reﬂect the impact of a default event expected to occur over the
remaining lifetime of the instrument rather than just over the 12 months from
the reporting date.

Speciﬁc qualitative and quantitative
criteria per segment:

Corporate & Institutional and

178

SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the
reporting date with the risk of default at origination (after considering the passage
Retail Banking clients
of time). ‘Signiﬁcant’ does not mean statistically signiﬁcant nor is it reﬂective of
the extent of the impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. Whether a change Private Banking clients
in the risk of default is signiﬁcant or not is assessed using quantitative and
Debt securities
qualitative criteria, the weight of which will depend on the type of product
and counterparty.
Assessment of
credit-impaired
ﬁnancial assets

Credit-impaired ﬁnancial assets comprise those assets that have experienced
an observed credit event and are in default. Default represents those assets
that are at least 90 days past due in respect of principal and interest payments
and/or where the assets are otherwise considered unlikely to pay. This deﬁnition
is consistent with internal credit risk management and the regulatory deﬁnition
of default.

Unlikely to pay factors include objective conditions such as bankruptcy, debt
restructuring, fraud or death. It also includes credit-related modiﬁcations of
contractual cash ﬂows due to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty (forbearance) where
the Group has granted concessions that it would not ordinarily consider.
Modiﬁed
ﬁnancial assets

Where the contractual terms of a ﬁnancial instrument have been modiﬁed, and
this does not result in the instrument being derecognised, a modiﬁcation gain or
loss is recognised in the income statement representing the difference between
the original cashﬂows and the modiﬁed cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective
interest rate. The modiﬁcation gain/loss is directly applied to the gross carrying
amount of the instrument.
If the modiﬁcation is credit-related, such as forbearance or where the Group
has granted concessions that it would not ordinarily consider, then it will be
considered credit-impaired. Modiﬁcations that are not credit related will be
subject to an assessment of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased
signiﬁcantly since origination by comparing the remaining lifetime probability of
default (PD) based on the modiﬁed terms to the remaining lifetime PD based
on the original contractual terms.

Transfers
between stages

Assets will transfer from stage 3 to stage 2 when they are no longer considered
to be credit-impaired. Assets will not be considered credit-impaired only if the
customer makes payments such that they are paid to current in line with the
original contractual terms. In addition:
¼

Loans that were subject to forbearance measures must remain current for
12 months before they can be transferred to stage 2

¼

Retail loans that were not subject to forbearance measures must remain
current for 180 days before they can be transferred to stage 2 or stage 1

Assets may transfer to stage 1 if they are no longer considered to have
experienced a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk. This will be immediate when
the original PD based transfer criteria are no longer met (and as long as none
of the other transfer criteria apply). Where assets were transferred using other
measures, the assets will only transfer back to stage 1 when the condition that
caused the signiﬁcant increase in credit risk no longer applies (and as long as
none of the other transfer criteria apply).
Governance and
application of
expert credit
judgement in
respect of
expected credit
losses

142

The determination of expected credit losses requires a signiﬁcant degree of
management judgement which had an impact on governance processes, with
the output of the expected credit models assessed by the IFRS 9 Impairment
Committee.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The table below presents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for its on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet ﬁnancial instruments as
at 31 December 2018, before and after taking into account any collateral held or other credit risk mitigation.
The Group’s on-balance sheet maximum exposure to credit risk increased by $27 billion to $667 billion (1 January 2018: $640 billion). This was
driven by a $10 billion increase in investment securities as the Group further strengthened its portfolio of high-quality liquid assets, as well as a
$9 billion increase in reverse repos held at fair value through proﬁt or loss primarily in the UK. Investment securities held at fair value through proﬁt
or loss increased by $1.8 billion as a result of deployment of funds in better quality assets. Further, other assets increased by $2.8 billion mainly
driven by cash collateral and unsettled trades due to settlement timing differences.

Strategic report

Maximum exposure to credit risk

Off-balance sheet credit risk exposures increased by $2 billion compared with 1 January 2018, primarily within contingent liabilities, offset by
a decrease in documentary credits and short-term trade-related transactions.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

This table shows ﬁnancial instruments and off-balance sheet commitments by stage, along with total credit impairment loss provision against
each class of ﬁnancial instrument.
The proportion of ﬁnancial instruments held within stage 1 increased to 92 per cent, compared with 90 per cent at 1 January 2018. This
increase was primarily within Corporate & Institutional Banking loans and advances where the proportion of stage 1 loans rated as ‘Strong’ has
increased from 58 per cent to 62 per cent.

The proportion of instruments classiﬁed as stage 3 declined by $1.6 billion. This was driven by a combination of repayments, debt sales,
write-offs and upgrades within loans and advances to customers. The stage 3 cover ratio (excluding collateral) declined from 60 per cent to
59 per cent over the same period but remained stable including collateral.

Directors’ report

The proportion of stage 2 ﬁnancial instruments decreased to 7 per cent from 8 per cent at 1 January 2018, primarily from reductions in loans
and advances and undrawn commitments. This was largely due to an improvement in the credit quality of the Corporate & Institutional Banking
portfolio. Loans held on non-purely precautionary early alert in the Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking portfolios
declined by $3.9 billion as accounts repaid or regularised. Loans classed as ‘Higher risk’ increased by 4 per cent primarily within the Commercial
Banking segment. The stage 2 cover ratio declined to 2.4 per cent from 2.8 per cent at 1 January 2018 primarily due to improved credit quality
together with more high-quality collateral.

Analysis of ﬁnancial instrument by stage

2 These instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet. The ECL provision in respect of debt securities measured at FVOCI is held within reserves
3 These are off-balance sheet instruments. Only the ECL is recorded on-balance sheet as a ﬁnancial liability and therefore there is no “net carrying amount”. ECL allowances on

Credit quality analysis
Credit quality by client segment
For Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking portfolios, exposures are analysed by credit grade (CG), which plays a central
role in the quality assessment and monitoring of risk (page 199). All loans are assigned a CG, which is reviewed periodically and amended in light
of changes in the borrower’s circumstances or behaviour. CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts,
while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 (non-performing or defaulted) clients. The mapping of credit quality is as follows.
Mapping of credit quality
The Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine the credit quality for loans.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

All regions were lower compared with
1 January 2018, with the decline primarily
in ASEAN & South Asia. In Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking, stage 3 loans fell by $1.9 billion
compared with 1 January 2018 due to
repayments, debt sales, write-offs
and upgrades in Corporate & Institutional
Banking. Provisions against Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking loans also fell by $1.2 billion from
$4.8 billion to $3.6 billion.
Inﬂows into stage 3 for Corporate &
Institutional Banking were 65 per cent
lower than 2017 reﬂecting the continued
improvement in the Corporate & Institutional
Banking portfolio. Stage 3 inﬂows increased
for Commercial Banking, driven by exposures
in Greater China & North Asia and Africa &
Middle East with no speciﬁc industry
concentration. The majority of new stage 3
counterparties in Corporate and Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking in 2018
had been on early alert for a period and do
not indicate new areas of stress.

Financial statements

In Commercial Banking, the proportion of
stage 1 loans declined from 79 per cent
to 78 per cent due to a small number of
downgrades to stage 2. However, the
proportion of stage 1 loans categorised as
‘Strong’ increased from 24 per cent to
25 per cent in line with the Group’s strategy
to increase the proportion of new loans to
higher credit quality clients. Across Corporate
& Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking, the largest industry contributors
to the growth in stage 1 lending were the
manufacturing sector, up $2.8 billion, and
loans to governments, up $4.0 billion.

In Corporate & Institutional Banking,
73 per cent of stage 2 loans were rated as
‘Satisfactory’ compared with 59 per cent at
1 January 2018. This does not represent a
decline in overall credit quality as it is primarily
driven by improvements in stage 2 investment
grade loans which repaid or transferred back
into stage 1. The majority of stage 2 loans
within Commercial Banking continue to be
classiﬁed as ‘Satisfactory’ (31 December
2018: 84 per cent; 1 January 2018:
82 per cent). Within Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking, overall
stage 2 loans decreased by $3.9 billion.
The reduction spread across a number of
sectors, with the manufacturing and ﬁnancing
and non-banking sectors seeing the largest
decreases, $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion
respectively, as early alert balances declined.

Stage 3 loans fell by $1.8 billion, or
21 per cent, compared with 1 January 2018,
with overall stage 3 provisions declining by
$1.2 billion to $4.1 billion. The stage 3 cover
ratio declined to 59 per cent from 60 per cent
largely driven by the impact of write-offs and
settlements in the liquidation portfolio.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

The proportion of Corporate & Institutional
Banking loans held within stage 1 improved
to 87 per cent from 81 per cent at 1 January
2018. This was concentrated in the ‘Strong’
category which increased from 58 per cent
of stage 1 loans at 1 January 2018 to
62 per cent at 31 December 2018, as the
Group continued to focus on the origination
of investment grade lending.

Stage 2 loans fell by $3.2 billion, or
15 per cent, compared with 1 January 2018,
primarily driven by a decline in Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking non-purely precautionary early
alert balances.

Retail Banking stage 2 loans increased by
$0.7 billion, mainly driven by a change in the
staging methodology in the Korea mortgage
portfolio. 69 per cent are within the ‘Strong’
category, and the proportion of past due
loans reduced from 34 per cent at 1 January
2018 to 31 per cent at 31 December 2018.
Driven by an increase in the proportion of
Mortgages held in Stage 2 and the rundown
of the high-risk segments in the personal
loans portfolio for ASEAN & South Asia,
the requirement for ECL coverage has
dropped from 7.8 per cent to 4.7 per cent.

Directors’ report

Stage 1 loans increased by 4 per cent
compared with 1 January 2018 and
represent 91 per cent of total loans and
advances to customers as of 31 December
2018. The largest increase of stage 1 loans
in any region was $4.1 billion in Europe &
Americas. Stage 1 loans in Greater China &
North Asia increased by $3.4 billion while
ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle
East were broadly stable over the year.

The proportion of Retail Banking stage 1
loans was slightly lower at 96 per cent of the
total portfolio compared with 97 per cent at
1 January 2018, with the proportion rated
as ‘Strong’ decreasing from 99 per cent to
98 per cent of total stage 1 loans mainly due
to the decrease of the mortgage portfolio
and the staging methodology change in the
Korea Mortgage portfolio. Stage 1 mortgage
loans declined by $4.4 billion, mainly due to
tightened regulations in Korea and price
competition in Hong Kong which resulted in
a reduction in new booking. This was offset
by growth of $3.8 billion in secured wealth
products and $0.7 billion in credit cards
and personal loans (CCPL) and other
unsecured lending.

Strategic report

The table overleaf sets out the gross loans
and advances held at amortised cost,
expected credit loss provisions and expected
credit loss coverage by business segment
and stage. Expected credit loss coverage
represents the expected credit loss reported
for each segment and stage as a proportion
of the gross loan balance for each segment
and stage.

Retail stage 3 loans were broadly stable at
$0.8 billion.

RISK REVIEW

Risk proﬁle

Movement in gross exposures
and credit impairment for loans
and advances, debt securities,
undrawn commitments and
ﬁnancial guarantees

¼

Net changes in exposures – comprises
new business written less repayments in
the year. Within stage 1, new business
written will attract up to 12 months of
expected credit loss charges. Repayments
of non-amortising loans (primarily within
Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking) will have low
amounts of expected credit loss provisions
attributed to them, due to the release
of provisions over the term to maturity.
In stages 2 and 3, the amounts principally
reﬂect repayments although stage 2 may
include new business written where clients
are on non-purely precautionary early
alert, are a credit grade 12, or when
non-investment grade debt securities
are acquired

Retail Banking stage 1 exposures increased
by $2 billion to $133 billion at 31 December
2018, driven by increased lending of secured
wealth products, which along with portfolio
quality improvements resulted in stage 1
provisions reducing from $381 million to
$313 million. Stage 2 exposures increased
from $8 billion at 1 January 2018 to
$8.9 billion at 31 December 2018, largely
due to increased inﬂows of mortgages,
which contributed to a reduction in stage 2
provisions from $178 million at 1 January
2018 to $132 million at 31 December 2018.
The increase in provisions from ‘Changes in
risk parameters’ within stage 2 reﬂects the
normal ﬂow of accounts and is not in itself an
indicator that there is a signiﬁcant weakness
in the portfolio.

¼

Changes in risk parameters – for
stages 1 and 2, this reﬂects changes in the
probability of default (PD), loss given default
(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) of
assets during the year, which includes the
impact of releasing provisions over the
term to maturity. It also includes the effect
of changes in forecasts of macroeconomic
variables during the year. In stage 3,
this line represents additional speciﬁc
provisions recognised on exposures held
within stage 3

Across both stage 1 and stage 2 for
all segments, the improvement in
macroeconomic forecasts during the
year reduced stage 1 and 2 provisions
by $42 million within an overall benign
environment.

The tables overleaf set out the movement in
gross exposures and credit impairment by
stage in respect of amortised cost loans to
banks and customers, undrawn committed
facilities, undrawn cancellable facilities,
debt securities classiﬁed at amortised
cost and FVOCI and ﬁnancial guarantees.
The tables are presented for the Group,
and the Corporate & Institutional Banking,
Commercial Banking and Retail Banking
segments.
Methodology
The movement lines within the tables are
an aggregation of monthly movements
over the year and will therefore reﬂect the
accumulation of multiple trades during the
year. The credit impairment charge in the
income statement comprises the amounts
within the boxes in the table below less
recoveries of amounts previously written off.
The approach for determining the key line
items in the tables is set out below.

Transfers – transfers between stages
are deemed to occur at the beginning
of a month based on prior month
closing balances
Net remeasurement from stage
changes – the remeasurement of credit
impairment provisions arising from a
change in stage is reported within the
stage that the assets are transferred to.
For example, assets transferred into
stage 2 are remeasured from a 12 month
to a lifetime expected credit loss, with
the effect of remeasurement reported in
stage 2. For stage 3, this represents the
initial remeasurement from speciﬁc
provisions recognised on individual
assets transferred into stage 3 in the year

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Movements during the year
For Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking businesses, the
gross exposures in stage 1 increased from
$292 billion at 1 January 2018 to $305 billion
at 31 December 2018, primarily due to
new business written within Corporate &
Institutional Banking. This contributed to
the increase in stage 1 provisions from
$154 million to $181 million offset by
improvements in credit quality across the
portfolio. Within stage 2 gross exposures
and credit impairment provisions declined
compared with 1 January 2018, largely
driven by a lower level of exposures within
Corporate & Institutional Banking on
non-purely precautionary early alert, which
either repaid or transferred back to stage 1.

Across all segments, at 31 December
2018 approximately 35 per cent of gross
exposures held in stage 2 are as a result of
meeting the PD signiﬁcant increase in credit
risk thresholds, 24 per cent as a result of
having ‘higher risk’ credit quality, 13 per cent
due to being on non-purely precautionary
early alert, 11 per cent being more than
30 days past due with the remainder primarily
relating to Private Banking and other factors.
Stage 3 exposures fell from $9.2 billion
at 1 January 2018 to $7.6 billion at
31 December, primarily due to repayments
and write-offs within Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking, and this
was also reﬂected in lower stage 3 provisions,
which fell from $5.6 billion at 1 January 2018
to $4.4 billion at 31 December 2018.

Credit impairment charge

The ongoing business credit impairment
charge in Corporate & Institutional Banking
of $229 million for 2018 is 65 per cent lower
than 2017. This was due to lower stage 3
impairment which was driven by lower losses
particularly in ASEAN & South Asia and
recoveries from a small number of major
exposures in India and the Middle East.

(385)

Commercial Banking ongoing business credit
impairment charge increased by 45 per cent
(2018: $244 million, 2017: $168 million)
compared to 2017, which saw a release of
$63 million of portfolio impairment provisions
held against certain sectors of the portfolios
that were no longer required. Africa & Middle
East contributed 60 per cent of the full-year
2018 charge.
Retail Banking credit impairment reduced
29 per cent (2018: $267 million, 2017:
$374 million), mainly driven by continued
improvement in portfolio shape and
performance, particularly within the
unsecured portfolios, as well as one-off
provision releases in Korea and Indonesia.

Stage 3 reductions were partly offset by
lower releases of $12 million in stage 1 and 2
compared to Portfolio Impairment Provisions
(PIP under IAS 39) as 2017 beneﬁted from
material releases of PIP speciﬁc risk
adjustments of $190 million.
In the liquidation portfolio, there was a net
release of $79 million due to loan disposals
and repayments.

Financial statements

The total ongoing credit impairment charge
decreased signiﬁcantly to $740 million in 2018
(2017: $1.2 billion), down 38 per cent primarily
due to improvements in portfolio quality
driven by signiﬁcant actions taken since
2016 to improve the Group’s credit quality.

Credit-impaired (stage 3) loans and advances by client segment
Gross credit-impaired (stage 3) loans for the Group are down 21 per cent in the year, to $6.9 billion (1 January 2018: $8.8 billion) with
signiﬁcant reductions in the liquidation portfolio as we continued to exit these exposures. Gross stage 3 loans in the ongoing business
decreased to $5.6 billion (1 January 2018: $6.5 billion), driven by repayments, debt sales, write-offs and transfers to stage 2 in Corporate &
Institutional Banking.
The inﬂows of stage 3 loans in Corporate & Institutional Banking were also signiﬁcantly lower, at around 35 per cent of the level seen in 2017
(2018: $0.8 billion; 2017: $2.3 billion), reﬂecting the continued improvement in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portfolio. Stage 3 inﬂows in
Commercial Banking were higher (2018: $0.6 billion; 2017: $0.4 billion), driven by exposures in Greater China & North Asia and Africa & Middle
East. Stage 3 loans in Retail Banking were broadly stable (31 December 2018: $0.8 billion; 1 January 2018: $0.8 billion).
Stage 3 cover ratio
The stage 3 cover ratio measures the proportion of stage 3 impairment provisions to gross stage 3 loans, and is a metric commonly used in
considering impairment trends. This metric does not allow for variations in the composition of stage 3 loans and should be used in conjunction
with other credit risk information provided, including the level of collateral cover.
The cover ratio before collateral for Corporate & Institutional Banking reduced from 59 per cent to 57 per cent due to debt sales and write-offs
on clients who had a high level of provisions. The cover ratio for Retail Banking remained stable at 48 per cent and cover ratio including collateral
improved to 87 per cent (1 January 2018: 74 per cent).
The Private Banking segment remains fully covered taking into account the collateral held.
The balance of stage 3 loans not covered by stage 3 impairment provisions represents the adjusted value of collateral held and the net outcome
of any workout or recovery strategies.
Collateral provides risk mitigation to some degree in all client segments and supports the credit quality and cover ratio assessments post
impairment provisions. Further information on collateral is provided in the credit risk mitigation section.
The table below presents the balance of the gross stage 3 loans to banks and customers, together with the provisions held, for all segments
and the respective cover ratios. For the reconciliation between the non-performing loans under IAS 39 and under IFRS 9, refer to Note 41.

Movement of credit-impaired (stage 3) loans and advances provisions by client segment
Credit impairment provisions as at 31 December 2018 were $4,056 million, compared with $5,286 million as at 1 January 2018, with the
decrease largely due to material reductions in Corporate & Institutional Banking.
The Corporate & Institutional Banking credit impairment provisions as at 31 December 2018 decreased by 32 per cent ($1,111 million) compared
with 1 January 2018 driven by write-offs and lower new provisions taken in 2018.

Potential credit losses from any given
account, customer or portfolio are mitigated
using a range of tools such as collateral,
netting arrangements, credit insurance
and credit derivatives, taking into account
expected volatility and guarantees.

Collateral
The requirement for collateral is not a
substitute for the ability to pay, which
is the primary consideration for any
lending decisions.

For loans and advances to customers and
banks (including those held at fair value
through proﬁt or loss), the table below sets
out the fair value of collateral held by the
Group, adjusted where appropriate in
accordance with the risk mitigation policy
and for the effect of over-collateralisation.

Supplementary information

The unadjusted market value of collateral
across all asset types, in respect of
Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking, without adjusting
for over-collateralisation, was $265 billion
(2017: $247 billion).

We have remained prudent in the way
we assess the value of collateral, which
is calibrated for a severe downturn and
backtested against our prior experience.
On average, across all types of non-cash
collateral, the value ascribed is approximately
half of its current market value. Collateral held
against Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking exposures amounted
to $23 billion.

In the Retail Banking and Private Banking
segments, a secured loan is one where the
borrower pledges an asset as collateral of
which the Group is able to take possession
in the event that the borrower defaults.
The collateral level for Retail Banking has
decreased by $2 billion in 2018. This is
in line with the overall movement of the
secured portfolio.

Financial statements

The reliance that can be placed on these
mitigants is carefully assessed in light
of issues such as legal certainty and
enforceability, market valuation correlation
and counterparty risk of the guarantor.

The collateral values in the table below are
adjusted where appropriate in accordance
with our risk mitigation policy and for the
effect of over-collateralisation. Following the
adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the
extent of over-collateralisation has been
determined with reference to both the drawn
and undrawn components of exposure as
this best reﬂects the effect of collateral and
other credit enhancements on the amounts
arising from expected credit losses. The 2017
comparatives have not been restated, as
the effect of collateral on IAS 39 impairment
provisions was based on the drawn
component only.

Collateral – Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking
Collateral held against Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking exposures amounted to $23 billion.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9, on
1 January 2018 $44.6 billion of reverse
repurchase loans, with associated collateral,
was classiﬁed and measured at fair value
through proﬁt and loss. 2017 comparatives
have not been restated.
Collateral taken for longer-term and subinvestment grade corporate loans continues
to be high at 51 per cent.

166

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Our underwriting standards encourage
taking speciﬁc charges on assets and we
consistently seek high-quality, investment
grade collateral. 83 per cent of tangible
collateral held comprises physical assets or
is property based, with the remainder largely
in cash and investment securities.
Non-tangible collateral such as guarantees
and standby letters of credit is also held
against corporate exposures, although the
ﬁnancial effect of this type of collateral is less
signiﬁcant in terms of recoveries. However,
this type of collateral is considered when
determining probability of default and other
credit-related factors. Collateral is also
held against off-balance sheet exposures,
including undrawn commitments and
trade-related instruments.

Mortgage loan-to-value ratios by geography
Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios measure the ratio of the current mortgage outstanding to the current fair value of the properties on which they are
secured.
In Mortgages, the value of property held as security signiﬁcantly exceeds the value of mortgage loans. The average LTV of the overall mortgage
portfolio is low at 45 per cent. Hong Kong, which represents 37 per cent of the Retail Banking mortgage portfolio has an average LTV of
39.2 per cent. All of our other key markets continue to have low portfolio LTVs, (Korea, Singapore and Taiwan at 43.5 per cent, 54.7 per cent
and 51.6 per cent respectively).
An analysis of LTV ratios by geography for the mortgage portfolio is presented in the mortgage LTV ratios by geography table below.

the excess is returned to the borrower.
Certain equity securities acquired may be
held by the Group for investment purposes
and are classiﬁed as fair value through other
comprehensive income, and the related loan
written off.

The carrying value of collateral possessed
and held by the Group as at 31 December
2018 is $18.2 million (2017: $24.1 million).
The decrease in collateral value is largely due
to the reduction in cash collateral following
utilisation to settle customer outstanding.

Other credit risk mitigation
Other forms of credit risk mitigation are set
out below.

The Private Banking loan book also
demonstrates a short-term bias, typical
for loans that are secured on wealth
management assets.
The Retail Banking loan book continues to be
longer-term in nature with 70 per cent of the
loans maturing over ﬁve years as mortgages
constitute the majority of this portfolio.

Supplementary information

Off-balance sheet exposures
For certain types of exposures, such as
letters of credit and guarantees, the Group
obtains collateral such as cash depending on
internal credit risk assessments, as well as in
the case of letters of credit holding legal title
to the underlying assets should a default
take place.

Maturity analysis of loans and advances
by client segment
The loans and advances to the Corporate
& Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking segments remain predominantly
short-term, with 60 per cent of loans and
advances to customers in the segments
maturing in less than one year, a decrease
compared with December 2017, and
96 per cent of loans to banks maturing in less
than one year. Shorter maturity gives us the
ﬂexibility to respond promptly to events and
rebalance or reduce our exposure to clients
or sectors that are facing increased pressure
or uncertainty.

Financial statements

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group enters into master netting
agreements, which in the event of default
result in a single amount owed by or to the
counterparty through netting the sum of
the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of applicable derivative transactions.
These are set out in more detail under
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments credit risk
mitigation (page 184).

Other portfolio analysis
This section provides maturity analysis by
business segment and industry and Retail
Products analysis by region.
RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Credit default swaps
The Group has entered into credit default
swaps for portfolio management purposes,
referencing loan assets with a notional value
of $21 billion (2017: $16 billion). These credit
default swaps are accounted for as ﬁnancial
guarantees as per IFRS 9. The Group
continues to hold the underlying assets
referenced in the credit default swaps and
it continues to be exposed to related credit
and foreign exchange risk on these assets.

analysis of loans and advances
by geographic region (unaudited)
This section provides an analysis of the
Group’s amortised cost loan portfolio, net
of provisions, by industry and region.
In the Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking segments our largest
industry exposure is manufacturing, which
constitutes 17 per cent of Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking loans and advances to customers
(1 January 2018: 16 per cent). The
manufacturing sector group is spread
across a diverse range of industries, including
automobiles and components, capital goods,
pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences,
technology hardware and equipment,
chemicals, paper products and packaging,
with lending spread over 4,639 clients.

170

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

285,553
77,739

The ﬁnancing, insurance and non-banking
industry group constitutes 15 per cent of
Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking loans and advances
to customers. Clients are mostly investment
grade institutions and this lending forms part
of the liquidity management of the Group.
Loans and advances to the energy sector
have dropped by 1 per cent to 12 per cent
of total loans and advances to Corporate
& Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking (1 January 2018: 13 per cent).
The energy sector lending is spread across
ﬁve subsectors and over 438 clients.
The Group provides loans to commercial
real estate counterparties of $15 billion,
which represents 6 per cent of total customer
loans and advances. In total, $8.8 billion of
this lending is to counterparties where the

2,974

612

81,325

source of repayment is substantially
derived from rental or sale of real estate
and is secured by real estate collateral.
The remaining commercial real estate loans
comprise working capital loans to real
estate corporates, loans with non-property
collateral, unsecured loans and loans to real
estate entities of diversiﬁed conglomerates.
The average LTV ratio of the commercial
real estate portfolio has increased to
43 per cent, compared with 41 per cent in
2017. The proportion of loans with an LTV
greater than 80 per cent has remained at
1 per cent during the same period.
The mortgage portfolio continues to be
the largest portion of the Retail Products
portfolio, at 66 per cent. CCPL and other
unsecured lending remain broadly stable at
15 per cent of total Retail Products loans
and advances.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Debt securities in the AAA rating category increased during the year by $24.5 billion to $55.4 billion. In line with the balance sheet growth,
the Group strengthened its portfolio of liquid assets by holding more highly rated securities mainly issued by the US and UK governments.
The increase in holdings of debt securities rated A- to A+ under stage 1 is mainly due to China sovereign rating downgrade from AA- to A+
by Standard & Poor’s. Stage 1 unrated debt securities have reduced by $3.3 billion mainly due to securities reported as unrated in prior years
having now been given a rating or maturing in 2018.

IFRS 9 methodology
Approach for determining expected credit losses
Credit loss terminology
Component

Deﬁnition

Probability of default (PD)

The probability that a counterparty will default, over the next 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the
lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating the impact of forward-looking economic assumptions that have
an effect on credit risk, such as interest rates, unemployment rates and GDP forecasts.
The PD estimates will ﬂuctuate in line with the economic cycle. The lifetime (or term structure) PDs are based on
statistical models, calibrated using historical data and adjusted to incorporate forward-looking economic
assumptions.

Loss given default (LGD)

The loss that is expected to arise on default, incorporating the impact of forward-looking economic assumptions
where relevant, which represents the difference between the contractual cash ﬂows due and those that the bank
expects to receive.
The Group estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates and considers the recovery of any collateral that
is integral to the ﬁnancial asset, taking into account forward-looking economic assumptions where relevant.

Exposure at default (EAD)

The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, taking into account the expected change in exposure
over the lifetime of the exposure. This incorporates the impact of drawdowns of committed facilities, repayments
of principal and interest, amortisation and prepayments, together with the impact of forward-looking economic
assumptions where relevant.

To determine the expected credit loss, these components are multiplied together (PD for the reference period (up to 12 months or lifetime) x LGD
at the beginning of the period x EAD at the beginning of the period) and discounted to the balance sheet date using the effective interest rate as
the discount rate.
Although the IFRS 9 models leverage the existing Basel advanced IRB risk components, several signiﬁcant adjustments are required to ensure
the resulting outcome is in line with the IFRS 9 requirements.

IFRS 9 expected credit loss models have
been developed for the Corporate &
Institutional Banking and Commercial
Banking businesses on a global basis, in line
with their respective portfolios. However,
for some of the most material countries,
country-speciﬁc models have also been
developed.

Retail Banking expected credit loss models
are country and product speciﬁc given the
local nature of the Retail Banking business.
For less material Retail Banking loan
portfolios, the Group has adopted simpliﬁed
approaches based on historical roll rates or
loss rates:

¼

For smaller Retail Banking portfolios, loss
rate models are applied. These use an
adjusted gross charge-off rate, developed
using monthly write-off and recoveries
over the preceding 12 months and total
outstanding balances

For a limited number of exposures, proxy
parameters or approaches are used where
the data is not available to calculate the
origination PDs and a proxy approach is
taken to apply the SICR criteria; or for some
retail portfolios where a full history of LGD
data is not available and estimates based on
the loss experience from similar portfolios are
used. The use of proxies is monitored and will
reduce over time.

Key assumptions and judgements in
determining expected credit loss
Incorporation of forward-looking
information
The evolving economic environment is a key
determinant of the ability of a bank’s clients
to meet their obligations as they fall due. It is
a fundamental principle of IFRS 9 that the
provisions banks hold against potential future
credit risk losses should depend not just on
the health of the economy today, but should
also take into account potential changes to
the economic environment. For example, if a
bank were to anticipate a sharp slowdown
in the world economy over the coming year,
it should hold more provisions today to
absorb the credit losses likely to occur in
the near future.

While this Base Forecast is the premise
for the Group’s strategic plan, one of the
key requirements of IFRS 9 is that the
assessment of provisions should be based
on a range of potential outcomes for the
future economic environment. For example,
the global economy may grow more quickly
or more slowly than the Base Forecast,
and these variations would have different
implications for the provisions that the Group
should hold today. As the negative impact
of an economic downturn on credit losses
tends to be greater than the positive impact
of an economic upturn, if the Group sets
provisions only on the expected credit loss
under the Base Forecast, it might not end up
with a level of provisions that appropriately
considers the range of potential outcomes.
To address this skewness (or non-linearity)
in expected credit loss, IFRS 9 requires the
ECL to be the probability-weighted amount
calculated for a range of possible outcomes.

To capture the effect of changes to the
economic environment, the PDs and LGDs
used to calculate expected credit loss,
incorporate forward-looking information in the
form of forecasts of the values of economic
variables and asset prices that are likely to
have an effect on the repayment ability of the
Group’s clients.

Supplementary information

For medium-sized Retail Banking
portfolios, a roll rate model is applied,
which uses a matrix that gives average
loan migration rate from delinquency
states from period to period. A matrix
multiplication is then performed to
generate the ﬁnal PDs by delinquency
bucket over different time horizons

Forecast of key macroeconomic
variables underlying the expected
credit loss calculation and the impact
on non-linearity
The Base Forecast – management’s view
of the most likely outcome – is that the
synchronised expansion of the global
economy will continue over the coming years
alongside a normalisation of monetary policy
in the developed world and the successful
rebalancing of the Chinese economy, with
US–China trade tensions putting China’s
export sectors under some pressure.

The ‘Base Forecast’ of the economic
variables and asset prices is based on

research team and outputs from models

and asset prices.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

The calibration of forward-looking
information is assessed at a country or
region level to take into account local
macroeconomic conditions.

Application of lifetime
Expected credit loss is estimated based
on the shorter of the expected life and the
maximum contractual period for which the
Group is exposed to credit risk. For Retail
Banking credit cards and Corporate &
Institutional Banking overdraft facilities,
however, the Group does not typically
enforce the contractual period. As a result,
for these instruments, the lifetime of the
exposure is based on the period the Group
is exposed to credit risk. This period has
been determined by reference to expected
behavioural life of the exposure and the
extent to which credit risk management
actions curtail the period of exposure. For
credit cards, this has resulted in an average
life of between 3 and 10 years across our
footprint markets. Overdraft facilities have
a 22-month lifetime.

RISK REVIEW

Risk proﬁle

To take account of the potential non-linearity
in expected credit loss, the Group simulates a
set of 50 scenarios around the Base Forecast
and calculates the expected credit loss under
each of them. These scenarios are generated
by a Monte Carlo simulation, which considers
the degree of uncertainty (or volatility) around
economic outcomes and how these
outcomes have tended to move in relation to
one another (or correlation). The use of Monte
Carlo simulation is motivated by the number
and spread of countries in which the Group
operates. This implies that the number of
countries’ macroeconomic variables to
forecast is large, but more importantly the
observation that a downturn in one part of the
world is never perfectly synchronised with
downturns everywhere else means that the
Group may be challenged to capture a full
range of scenarios with a handful of manually
tuned scenarios.
While the 50 scenarios do not each have a
speciﬁc narrative, they reﬂect a range of
plausible hypothetical alternative outcomes
for the global economy. Some imply an
unwinding of the current shocks and
uncertainty leading to higher global economic
activity and higher asset prices, while others
represent an intensiﬁcation of current shocks
China
Base
forecast

or introduction of new shocks that raise
uncertainty, leading to lower global economic
activity and lower asset prices.
The table below provides a summary of
the Group’s Base Forecast, alongside the
corresponding range seen across the
multiple scenarios.
Over the medium term – ﬁve years ahead –
there has been relatively little change in the
forecast level of activity relative to the start of
the year. At the margin, the ongoing trade
policy tensions between the US and China
have reduced prospective export growth in
China, particularly in the near term. The effect
of the external trade shock is expected to be
offset by moderate domestic policy stimulus
by Chinese authorities and so average real
GDP growth projections over the medium
term have been revised downwards only
marginally, to 6.0 per cent from 6.1 per cent.
Some policy stimulus was provided during
2018, for example an easing of monetary
policy by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC).
This policy stance is expected to persist
and so the projected average three-month
interbank interest rate over the medium
term has been revised down materially to
3.1 per cent from 4.2 per cent.
Hong Kong
Base
forecast

Korea
Base
forecast

In contrast to the Chinese economy, the US
economy continued to grow above trend
during 2018, prompting the Federal Reserve
to raise US policy interest rates faster than
expected. For those countries where the
monetary policy framework is based on
managing the level of the currency in
reference to the US dollar – either as a
currency board (Hong Kong) or as a currency
basket (Singapore) – domestic interest rates
rise, to some degree, with US interest rates.
The revised outlook for short-term interbank
interest rates is not expected to have a
material effect on activity, property price
inﬂation or unemployment in those countries
over the medium term.
The most material revision in the base
forecast is to the oil price. At the start of the
year oil prices were expected to average
around US$61/barrel over the medium term,
but by the end of the year that projection
had been revised up to around US$85.
While current prices have been impacted by
speculative movements out of oil, a number
of supply and demand factors together
determine the oil price. The most important
driver of the rise in projected oil prices over
the medium term was the decision by the US
government not to renew waivers on certain
sanctions on Iran, including the export of oil.

Assets are considered to have experienced
SICR if they have breached both relative and
absolute thresholds for the change in the
average annualised lifetime probability of
default over the residual term of the exposure.

Stability – The thresholds are set to achieve
a stable stage 2 population at a portfolio
level, trying to minimise the number of
accounts moving back and forth between
stage 1 and stage 2 in a short period
of time

¼

Accuracy – The thresholds are set such
that there is a materially higher propensity
for stage 2 exposures to eventually default
than is the case for stage 1 exposures

¼

Dependency from backstops – The
thresholds are stringent enough such that
a high proportion of accounts transfer to
stage 2 due to movements in forwardlooking PD rather than relying on
backward-looking backstops such
as arrears

¼

Relationship with business and product
risk proﬁles – The thresholds reﬂect the
relative risk differences between different
products, and are aligned to business
processes

For Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking clients, the relative
threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD
and the absolute change in PD is between
50 and 100 bps.
For Retail Banking clients, the relative
threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD
and the absolute change in PD is between
100 and 350 bps depending on the product.
Certain countries have a higher absolute
threshold reﬂecting the lower default rate
within their personal loan portfolios
compared with the Group’s other
personal loan portfolios.
Private Banking clients are assessed
qualitatively, based on a delinquency
measure relating to collateral top-ups or
sell-downs.
Debt securities with an internal credit rating
mapped to an investment grade equivalent
are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt
securities to stage 2.

Supplementary information

As the Group has two principal uncertainties
related to the macroeconomic outlook, a
sensitivity analysis of ECL was undertaken
to explore the combined effect of these:
extended trade tensions that could lead to a
China slowdown with spillovers to emerging
markets. In this scenario, current trade policy
tensions between the US and China increase
dramatically. The US targets trading partners
with which it has a material trade deﬁcit
and pushes through highly protectionist
measures, initiating trade tensions with Asia
focused on China. Indirectly, economies

Signiﬁcant increase in credit risk
Quantitative criteria
SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of
default at the reporting date to the risk of
default at origination. Whether a change
in the risk of default is signiﬁcant or not is
assessed using quantitative and qualitative
criteria. These quantitative signiﬁcant
deterioration thresholds have been separately
deﬁned for each business and where
meaningful are consistently applied across
business lines.

¼

Financial statements

The primary conclusion of these exercises is
that no individual macroeconomic variable is
materially inﬂuential – that is, likely to result in
an impact of at least 1 per cent of the Group’s
expected credit loss. The Group believes
this is plausible, because the number of
variables used in the expected credit loss
calculation is large. This does not mean that
macroeconomic variables are uninﬂuential;
rather, that the Group believes that
consideration of macroeconomics should
involve whole scenarios, as this aligns with
the multi-variable nature of the calculation.

Applying this scenario, modelled stage 1
and 2 expected credit loss provisions would
be approximately $362 million higher than
the reported base case expected credit
loss provision (excluding the impact of
non-linearity). This includes the impact of
exposures transferring to stage 2 from stage
1 but does not consider an increase in stage
3 defaults. The proportion of exposures in
stage 2 would increase from 8 per cent to
10 per cent. As expected, this has an impact
on our corporate exposures in China, Hong
Kong and Singapore. Within Retail Banking,
the Group’s credit card portfolios in Hong
Kong and Singapore were impacted.
Note that the actual outcome of any scenario
may be materially different due to, amongst
other factors, the effect of management
actions to mitigate potential increases in risk
and changes in the underlying portfolio.

The SICR thresholds have been calibrated
based on the following principles:

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Sensitivity of expected credit loss
calculation to macroeconomic variables
The expected credit loss calculation relies on
multiple variables and is inherently non-linear
and portfolio-dependent, which implies that
no single analysis can fully demonstrate the
sensitivity of the expected credit loss to
changes in the macroeconomic variables.
The Group has conducted a series of
analyses with the aim of identifying the
macroeconomic variables which might have
the greatest impact on overall expected credit
loss. These encompassed single variable
and multi-variable exercises, using simple
up/down variation and extracts from actual
calculation data, as well as bespoke scenario
design and assessment.

The absolute measure of increase in credit
risk is used to capture instances where the
PDs on exposures are relatively low at initial
recognition as these may increase by several
multiples without representing a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk. Where PDs are
relatively high at initial recognition, a relative
measure is more appropriate in assessing
whether there is a signiﬁcant increase in
credit risk, as the PDs increase more quickly.

Directors’ report

Credit-impaired assets managed by Group
Special Assets Management (GSAM)
incorporate forward-looking economic
assumptions in respect of the recovery
outcomes identiﬁed and are assigned
individual probability weightings. These
assumptions are not based on a Monte
Carlo simulation but are informed by the
Base Forecast.

reliant on global trade ﬂows are vulnerable
to the trade shock. The escalating trade
tensions create uncertainty which reduces
risk appetite, leading to a decline in asset
prices and lower consumption and
investment across developed and emerging
markets. This leads to a global slowdown
and a sharp fall in commodity prices. As an
indication, China annual real GDP growth
troughs at circa. 4 per cent, representing a
marked divergence from the base forecast
growth of around 6 per cent, while China
exports growth dips negative for the ﬁrst time
since 2009. US GDP slows from a trend rate
of about 2 per cent down to 1 per cent.
Crude oil prices fall, and residential property
indices in China and Hong Kong dip negative.
To contextualise this scenario relative to the
Monte Carlo generated scenarios, the China
and US GDP dips approach the lowest
growth boundary of the 50 scenarios in 2019,
crude oil remains closer to the middle than
to the bottom edge, but the China property
price index falls well below the simulated
lower bound over a period of years.

Strategic report

The average expected credit loss under
multiple scenarios is 2.1 per cent higher than
the expected credit loss calculated using only
the most likely scenario (the Base Forecast).
Portfolios that are more sensitive to nonlinearity include those with greater leverage
and/or a longer tenor, such as Project and
Shipping Finance portfolios. Other portfolios
display minimal non-linearity owing to limited
their responsiveness to macroeconomic
impacts for structural reasons such as
signiﬁcant collateralisation as with the
Retail Banking mortgage portfolios.

Qualitative criteria
Qualitative factors that indicate that there
has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk
include processes linked to current risk
management, such as placing loans on
non-purely precautionary early alert.

RISK REVIEW

Risk proﬁle

Backstop
Across all portfolios, accounts that are 30 or
more days past due (DPD) on contractual
payments of principal and/or interest that
have not been captured by the criteria
above are considered to have experienced
a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk.
Expert credit judgement may be applied in
assessing signiﬁcant increase in credit risk
to the extent that certain risks may not have
been captured by the models or through the
above criteria. Such instances are expected
to be rare, for example due to events arising
close to the reporting date.
Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking clients
Quantitative criteria
Exposures are assessed based on both the
absolute and the relative movement in the
PD from origination to the reporting date as
described above.
To account for the fact that the mapping
between internal credit grades (used in the
origination process) and PDs is non-linear
(e.g. a one-notch downgrade in the
investment grade universe results in a
much smaller PD increase than in the
sub-investment grade universe), the absolute
thresholds have been differentiated by
credit quality at origination, as measured
by internal credit grades being investment
grade or sub-investment grade.
Qualitative criteria
All assets of clients that have been placed
on early alert (for non-purely precautionary
reasons) are deemed to have experienced
a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk.
An account is placed on non-purely
precautionary early alert if it exhibits risk or
potential weaknesses of a material nature
requiring closer monitoring, supervision or
attention by management. Weaknesses
in such a borrower’s account, if left
uncorrected, could result in deterioration of
repayment prospects and the likelihood of
being downgraded. Indicators could include
a rapid erosion of position within the industry,
concerns over management’s ability to
manage operations, weak/deteriorating
operating results, liquidity strain and overdue
balances among other factors.
All client assets that have been assigned a
CG12 rating, equivalent to ‘higher risk’, are
deemed to have experienced a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk. Accounts rated
CG12 are managed by the GSAM unit.
All Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking clients are placed
on CG12 when they are 30 DPD unless
they are granted a waiver through a strict
governance process.

(page 177). For these portfolios, the original
lifetime PD term structure is determined
based on the original application score or
risk segment of the client.
Qualitative criteria
Accounts that are 30 DPD that have not
been captured by the quantitative criteria are
considered to have experienced a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk. For less material
portfolios, which are modelled based on a
roll rate or loss rate approach, signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk is primarily assessed
through the 30 DPD trigger.
Private Banking clients
For Private Banking clients, signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk is assessed by
referencing the nature and the level of
collateral against which credit is extended
(known as ‘Classes of risk’).
Qualitative criteria
For all Private Banking classes, in line with
risk management practice, an increase in
credit risk is deemed to have occurred
where margining or LTV covenants have
been breached.
For Class I assets, if these margining
requirements have not been met within
30 days of a trigger, a signiﬁcant increase
in credit risk is assumed to have occurred.
For Class I and Class III assets, a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk is assumed to have
occurred where the bank is unable to ‘sell
down’ the applicable assets to meet revised
collateral requirements within ﬁve days of
a trigger.
Class II assets are typically unsecured
or partially secured, or secured against
illiquid collateral such as shares in private
companies. Signiﬁcant credit deterioration
of these assets is deemed to have
occurred when any early alert trigger
has been breached.
Debt securities
Quantitative criteria
The bank is utilising the low credit risk
simpliﬁed approach. All debt securities
with an internal credit rating mapped to an
investment grade equivalent are allocated
to stage 1 and all other debt securities are
allocated to stage 2.

Qualitative criteria
Debt securities utilise the same qualitative
criteria as the Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking client
segments, including being placed on early
alert or being classiﬁed as CG12.
Assessment of credit-impaired
ﬁnancial assets
Retail Banking clients
The core components in determining
credit-impaired expected credit loss
provisions are the value of gross charge-off
and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or
loss provisions are recognised when it is
established that the account is unlikely to pay
through the normal process. Recovery of
unsecured debt post credit impairment is
recognised based on actual cash collected,
either directly from clients or through the sale
of defaulted loans to third-party institutions.
Release of credit impairment provisions for
secured loans is recognised if the loan
outstanding is paid in full (release of full
provision), or the provision is higher than
the loan outstanding (release of the
excess provision).
Corporate & Institutional Banking,
Commercial Banking and Private
Banking clients
Credit-impaired accounts are managed by
the Group’s specialist recovery unit, Group
Special Assets Management (GSAM), which
is independent from its main businesses.
Where any amount is considered
irrecoverable, a stage 3 credit impairment
provision is raised. This stage 3 provision is
the difference between the loan-carrying
amount and the probability-weighted present
value of estimated future cash ﬂows,
reﬂecting a range of scenarios (typically
the best, worst and most likely recovery
outcomes). Where the cash ﬂows include
realisable collateral, the values used will
incorporate the impact of forward-looking
economic information.
The individual circumstances of each client
are considered when GSAM estimates
future cash ﬂows and timing of future
recoveries which involve signiﬁcant
judgement. All available sources, such as
cash ﬂow arising from operations, selling
assets or subsidiaries, realising collateral or
payments under guarantees, are considered.
In any decision relating to the raising of
provisions, the Group attempts to balance
economic conditions, local knowledge and
experience, and the results of independent
asset reviews.

Risk proﬁle

Country Risk (unaudited)
Country cross-border risk is the risk that the
Group will be unable to obtain payment from
counterparties on their contractual obligations
as a result of certain actions taken by foreign
governments, chieﬂy relating to convertibility
and transferability of foreign currency.
The proﬁle of the Group’s country crossborder exposures as at 31 December 2018
remained consistent with its strategic focus
on core franchise countries. Changes in
the pace of economic activity and portfolio
management activity had an impact on
the growth of cross-border exposure for
certain territories.
Country cross-border exposure to China
remains predominantly short-term
(85 per cent of exposure had a tenor of less
than one-year). During 2018, the Group’s
cross-border exposure to China decreased,
primarily driven by a loan portfolio reduction,
as well as repayment of some large-scale
term and bridge loans.

Country cross-border exposure to Hong
Kong rose marginally, with strong loan book
growth largely offset by a decline in trade
ﬁnance exposures; reﬂecting a more
subdued global trade environment and
domestic economic headwinds.
Singapore’s cross-border exposure declined
during 2018 due to a reduction in exposure
from corporate business loans and structured
ﬁnance transactions, partially offset by an
uptick in interbank exposures.
The increase in United Arab Emirates
cross-border exposure reﬂects growth in
the loan book and trade ﬁnance. Growth is
supported by new exposures to Abu Dhabi
government-related entities and core Dubai
corporates, increased reﬁnancing activities
and bridging loans to acquisition transactions.
The decrease in cross-border exposure
to South Korea reﬂects a reduction in
marketable securities held, as well as
economic and external headwinds stemming
from uncertainty around the ongoing trade
tensions and monetary tightening in the
United States.

India’s cross-border exposure declined,
primarily driven by facility roll-offs on the loan
book, as well as a reduction in both issuer
risk and private bank exposures.
Cross-border exposure to developed
countries in which the Group does not have
a major presence, predominantly relates to
treasury and liquidity management activities,
which can change signiﬁcantly from period
to period. Exposure to such markets also
represents global corporate business for
customers with interests in our footprint.
The increase in exposures to the United
States, Germany and Australia are all largely
attributed to Group liquidity management
operations during the year.
The table below, which is based on the
Group’s internal country cross-border risk
reporting requirements, shows crossborder exposures that exceed 1 per cent
of total assets.

Traded risk
Traded risk is the potential for loss resulting
from activities undertaken by the bank in
ﬁnancial markets. Under the Enterprise Risk
Management Framework, the introduction of
the Traded Risk Framework in 2018 sought
to bring together all risk types exhibiting risk
features common to traded risk.
These risk types include Market risk,
Counterparty Credit risk, Issuer risk, XVA,
Algorithmic trading and Pension risk.
Traded Risk Management (TRM, formerly
Market and Traded Credit Risk) is the core
risk management function supporting
market-facing businesses, speciﬁcally
Financial Markets and Treasury Markets.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Market risk
Market risk is the potential for loss of
economic value due to adverse changes in
ﬁnancial market rates or prices. The Group’s
exposure to market risk arises predominantly
from the following sources:
¼

Trading book: the Group provides clients
access to ﬁnancial markets, facilitation of
which entails the Group taking moderate
market risk positions. All trading teams
support client activity; there are no
proprietary trading teams. Hence, income
earned from market risk-related activities
is primarily driven by the volume of client
activity rather than risk-taking.

¼

Non-trading book:
–

The Treasury Markets desk is required
to hold a liquid assets buffer, much of
which is held in high-quality marketable
debt securities

–

The Group has capital invested and
related income streams denominated
in currencies other than US dollars.
To the extent that these are not hedged,
the Group is subject to structural
foreign exchange risk which is reﬂected
in reserves

A summary of our current policies and
practices regarding market risk management
is provided in the Principal Risks section
(page 202).

¼

Interest rate risk: arising from changes in yield curves, credit spreads and implied volatilities on interest rate options

¼

Foreign exchange rate risk: arising from changes in currency exchange rates and implied volatilities on foreign exchange options

¼

Commodity risk: arising from changes in commodity prices and implied volatilities on commodity options; covering energy, precious metals,
base metals and agriculture

¼

Equity risk: arising from changes in the prices of equities, equity indices, equity baskets and implied volatilities on related options

For the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2018 was lower than in 2017 by 19 per cent. Trading activities have remained relatively
unchanged and client-driven.

Directors’ report

Market risk changes
The average level of total trading and non-trading VaR in 2018 was 20 per cent lower than in 2017, but the actual level of total VaR as at year end
2018 was 14 per cent higher than in 2017. The reduction in the total average VaR was driven by the non-trading book, where the duration of
the portfolio in the ﬁrst half of 2018 was reduced. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018 the non-trading VaR increased, driven by both
an increase in the bond inventory size in high-quality assets from Treasury Markets and reduced portfolio diversiﬁcation.

Strategic report

The primary categories of market risk for the Group are:

1 Highest and lowest VaR for each risk factor are independent and usually occur on different days
2 Actual one day VaR at year end date
3 Interest rate risk VaR includes credit spread risk arising from securities accounted as FVTPL or FVOCI
4 The total VaR shown in the tables above is not a sum of the component risks, due to offsets between them

6 Non-trading equity risk VaR includes only listed equities

Risks not in VaR (unaudited)
In 2018, the main market risk not reﬂected in VaR was currency risk where the exchange rate is currently pegged or managed. The historical
one-year VaR observation period does not reﬂect the future possibility of a change in the currency regime such as sudden depegging. The other
material market risk not reﬂected in VaR was associated with basis risks where historical market price data for VaR is sometimes more limited,
and therefore proxied, generating a potential basis risk. Additional capital is set aside to cover such ‘risks not in VaR’. For further details on
market risk capital see the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures 2018 section on market risk.
Backtesting (unaudited)
Regulatory backtesting is applied at both Group and Solo levels. In 2018, there have been two negative exceptions at Group level and three at
Solo level (in 2017, there was one exception at Group level and one exception at Solo level).
Group and Solo exceptions occurred on 16 August 2018 driven by RMB which appreciated sharply due to PBoC intervention following a period
of decline. Additionally, Group and Solo exceptions occurred on 2 November 2018 driven by TWD and RMB exposures when Asian currencies
strengthened on talk of a draft trade deal between the US and China. On 15 November 2018 a Solo exception was driven by GBP and USD.
GBP depreciated as the draft Brexit agreement ran into difﬁculties, and US treasury yields fell as a result of safe haven purchases. Three
exceptions in a year due to market events is within the ‘green zone’ applied internationally to internal models by bank supervisors (Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision: ‘Supervisory framework for the use of backtesting in conjunction with the internal models approach to
market risk capital requirements’, January 1996).
The graph below illustrates the performance of the VaR model used in capital calculations. It compares the 99 percentile loss conﬁdence level
given by the VaR model with the hypothetical proﬁt and loss of each day given the actual market movement without taking into account any
intra-day trading activity.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Mapping of market risk items to the balance sheet (unaudited)
Market risk contributes 7.4 per cent of the Group’s regulatory capital risk-weighted asset (RWA) requirement (refer to risk-weighted assets tables
(page 221)). As highlighted in the VaR disclosure, during 2018 the majority of market risk was managed within Treasury Markets and Financial
Markets, which span both the trading book and non-trading book. The non-trading equity market risk is generated by listed private equity
holdings within Principal Finance. Treasury manages the market risk associated with debt and equity capital issuance.

the Renminbi and $712 million to partly cover
its exposure to the Indian rupee. An analysis
has been performed on these exposures
to assess the impact of a 1 per cent fall in
the US dollar exchange rates, adjusted to
incorporate the impacts of correlations of
these currencies to the US dollar. The impact
on the positions above would be an increase
of $336 million (2017: $357 million). Changes
in the valuation of these positions are taken
to reserves.

In addition, the Group enters into credit
support annexes (CSAs) with counterparties
where collateral is deemed a necessary
or desirable mitigant to the exposure.
Cash collateral includes collateral called
under a variation margin process from
counterparties if total uncollateralised
mark-to-market exposure exceeds the
threshold and minimum transfer amount
speciﬁed in the CSA. With certain
counterparties, the CSA is reciprocal and
requires us to post collateral if the overall
mark-to-market values of positions are
in the counterparty’s favour and exceed
an agreed threshold. The Group holds
$6,834 million (2017: $6,562 million)
under CSAs.

Liquidity and Funding risk

For analysis of the Group’s capital position
and requirements, refer to the Capital Review
(page 218).

Liquidity and Funding risk is the risk that we
may not have sufﬁcient stable or diverse
sources of funding to meet our obligations
as they fall due.

Counterparty credit risk
Counterparty credit risk is the potential for
loss in the event of the default of a derivative
counterparty, after taking into account the
value of eligible collaterals and risk mitigation
techniques. The Group’s counterparty
credit exposures are included in the Credit
risk section.

The Group’s liquidity and funding risk
approach requires each country to ensure
that it operates within predeﬁned liquidity
limits and remain in compliance with Group
liquidity policies and practices, as well as
local regulatory requirements.

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
credit risk mitigation
The Group enters into master netting
agreements, which in the event of default
result in a single amount owed by or to the
counterparty through netting the sum of
the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of applicable derivative transactions.
The value of exposure under master
netting agreements is $32,283 million
(2017: $29,135 million).

The Group achieves this through a
combination of setting Risk Appetite and
associated limits, policy formation, risk
measurement and monitoring, prudential
and internal stress testing, governance
and review.
Since the beginning of the year, there were
no signiﬁcant changes in treasury policies
as disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report
and Accounts.
The Group has relatively low levels of sterling
and euro funding and exposures within the
context of the overall Group balance sheet.

The result of the UK referendum to leave the
EU has therefore not had a material ﬁrst order
liquidity impact.
Primary sources of funding
The Group’s funding strategy is largely driven
by its policy to maintain adequate liquidity at
all times, in all geographic locations and for
all currencies, and hence to be in a position
to meet all obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s funding proﬁle is therefore well
diversiﬁed across different sources, maturities
and currencies.
A substantial portion of our assets are funded
by customer deposits aligned with our policy
to fund customer assets predominantly
using customer deposits. Wholesale funding
is diversiﬁed by type and maturity and
represents a stable source of funds for
the Group.
We maintain access to wholesale funding
markets in all major ﬁnancial centres in which
we operate. This seeks to ensure that we
have market intelligence, maintain stable
funding lines and can obtain optimal pricing
when performing our interest rate risk
management activities.
In 2018, the Group issued approximately
$4.6 billion of senior debt securities and
$0.5 billion of subordinated debt securities
from its holding company (HoldCo) Standard
Chartered PLC (2017: $1.5 billion of term
senior debt and $1 billion of Additional Tier 1).
Debt reﬁnancing levels are low. In the next
12 months approximately $3.9 billion of the
Group’s HoldCo senior debt is falling due for
repayment either contractually or callable by
the Group.
The information presented in the Liquidity
pool section (page 186) is on a ﬁnancial view.
This is the location in which the transaction
or balance was booked and provides a
more accurate view of where liquidity risk
is actually located.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (unaudited)
The LCR is a regulatory requirement set
to ensure that the Group has sufﬁcient
unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to
meet its liquidity needs in a 30-calendar-day
liquidity stress scenario.
The Group monitors and reports its liquidity
position under European Commission
Delegated Regulation 2015/61 and has
maintained its liquidity position above the
prudential requirement.

At the reporting date, the Group LCR was
154 per cent (2017: 146 per cent) with a
prudent surplus to both Board-approved
Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements.
The ratio increased 8 per cent year-on-year
due to an increase in our liquidity buffer
partially aligned to the growth in our overall
balance sheet as we continued to focus on
high-quality liquidity across our businesses.
We also held adequate liquidity across our
footprint to meet all local prudential LCR
requirements, where applicable.

Stressed coverage (unaudited)
The Group intends to maintain a prudent
and sustainable funding and liquidity position,
in all countries and currencies, such that
it can withstand a severe but plausible
liquidity stress.

“The Group should hold an adequate buffer
of high-quality liquid assets to survive extreme
but plausible liquidity stress scenarios for
at least 60 days without recourse to
extraordinary central bank support.”
The Group’s internal liquidity stress
testing framework covers the following
stress scenarios:
¼

Standard Chartered-speciﬁc – this
scenario captures the liquidity impact from
an idiosyncratic event affecting Standard
Chartered only i.e. the rest of the market
is assumed to operate normally

Market wide – this scenario captures the
liquidity impact from a market wide crisis
affecting all participants in a country, region
or globally

¼

Combined – this scenario assumes
both Standard Chartered-speciﬁc and
Market-wide events affecting the Group
simultaneously and hence the most
severe scenario

All scenarios include, but are not limited to,
modelled outﬂows for retail and wholesale
funding, off-balance sheet funding risk, cross
currency funding risk, intraday risk, franchise
risk and risks associated with a deterioration
of a ﬁrm’s credit rating.
Stress testing results show that a positive
surplus was maintained under all scenarios at
31 December 2018 i.e. respective countries
are able to survive for a period of time as
deﬁned under each scenario. The Combined
scenario at 31 December 2018 showed
the Group maintained liquidity resources
to survive greater than 60 days, as per
our Board Risk Appetite. The results take
into account currency convertibility and
portability constraints across all major
presence countries.

Standard Chartered Bank’s credit ratings as
at 31 December 2018 were A+ with stable
outlook (Fitch), A with stable outlook (S&P)
and A1 with stable outlook (Moody’s).
A downgrade in the Group’s long-term credit
ratings would increase derivative collateral
requirements and outﬂows due to ratinglinked liabilities. At 31 December 2018, the
estimated contractual outﬂow of a two-notch
long-term ratings downgrade is $1.6 billion
(unaudited).
For further information on the Group’s
liquidity stress testing framework refer to the
Risk Management Approach (page 205).

External wholesale borrowing
The Board sets a risk limit to prevent
excessive reliance on wholesale borrowing.
Limits are applied to all branches and
operating subsidiaries in the Group and as
at the reporting date the Group remained
within Board Risk Appetite.

Strategic report

The chart below shows the composition of liabilities in which customer deposits make up 63.5 per cent of total liabilities as at 31 December
2018, the majority of which are current accounts, savings accounts and time deposits. Our largest customer deposit base by geography is
Greater China & North Asia (in particular Hong Kong), which holds 44.9 per cent of Group customer accounts.

Advances-to-deposits ratio
This is deﬁned as the ratio of total loans
and advances to customers relative to
total customer accounts. An advances-todeposits ratio of below 100 per cent
demonstrates that customer deposits exceed

RISK REVIEW

Risk proﬁle

customer loans as a result of the emphasis
placed on generating a high level of funding
from customers.
The advances-to-deposits ratio (2018:
64.9 per cent) decreased from the previous
year (2017: 67.0 per cent).
Loans and advances to customers have
increased 3 per cent since the end of 2017

to $258 billion. This growth was largely due
to higher Corporate Finance balances in
Hong Kong as well as growth in our
Transaction Banking and Wealth
Management businesses. This growth was
partially offset by a reduction in lending
and retail mortgages primarily due to
unfavourable foreign exchange movements
in Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong.

Customer accounts have also increased
6 per cent from the end of 2017 to
$398 billion as the Group focused on
high-quality liquidity across its businesses
with an emphasis on Retail Banking,
Transaction Banking and other deposits
with high liquidity and regulatory value.

Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)
(unaudited)
On 23 November 2016, the European
Commission, as part of a package of
risk-reducing measures, proposed a binding
requirement for stable funding NSFR at
European Union level. The proposal aims to
implement the European Banking Authority’s
interpretation of the Basel standard on NSFR
(BCBS295). Pending implementation of the
ﬁnal rules, the Group continues to monitor
NSFR in line with the ﬁnal recommendation
from the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS).
The NSFR is a balance sheet metric which
requires institutions to maintain a stable
funding proﬁle in relation to the characteristics
of their assets and off-balance sheet activities

over a one-year horizon. It is the ratio
between the amount of available stable
funding (ASF) and the amount of required
stable funding (RSF). ASF factors are applied
to balance sheet liabilities and capital, based
on their perceived stability and the amount of
stable funding they provide. Likewise, RSF
factors are applied to assets and off-balance
sheet exposures according to the amount
of stable funding they require. At the last
reporting date, the Group NSFR remained
above 100 per cent.
Liquidity pool (unaudited)
The liquidity value of the Group’s LCR eligible
liquidity pool at the reporting date was
$150 billion. The ﬁgures in the below table
account for haircuts, currency convertibility

and portability constraints, and therefore are
not directly comparable with the consolidated
balance sheet. The pool is held to offset
stress outﬂows as deﬁned in European
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61.
The pool increased $17 billion year-on-year,
reﬂecting overall balance sheet growth as
we continued to improve the quality of our
funding base and focus on growing quality
and RWA efﬁcient assets. Our liquidity pool
composition also changed over the period
as we increased our holdings of Level 2A
LCR eligible securities.

Derivatives, reverse repurchase assets
and stock lending
These assets are shown separately as
these on-balance sheet amounts cannot
be pledged. However, these assets can
give rise to off-balance sheet collateral
which can be used to raise secured funding
or meet additional funding requirements.

Unencumbered – other assets capable
of being encumbered
Unencumbered assets that, in their current
form, are not considered by the Group to
be readily realisable in the normal course of
business to secure funding, meet collateral
needs, or be sold to reduce potential future
funding requirements and are not subject
to any restrictions on their use for these
purposes. Included within this category are
loans and advances which would be suitable
for use in secured funding structures such
as securitisations.

The following table provides a reconciliation
of the Group’s encumbered assets to
total assets.

Contractual maturity of assets and liabilities
The following table presents assets and liabilities by maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date as at the
balance sheet date on a discounted basis. Contractual maturities do not necessarily reﬂect actual repayments or cashﬂows.

As at the reporting date, assets remain predominantly short-dated, with 61 per cent maturing in under one year. Our less than three month
cumulative net funding gap increased from the previous year, largely due to an increase in customer accounts as the Group focused on
improving the quality of its deposit base. In practice, these deposits are recognised as stable and have behavioural proﬁles that extend beyond
their contractual maturities.

The cash ﬂows presented in the previous
section reﬂect the cash ﬂows that will be
contractually payable over the residual
maturity of the instruments. However,
contractual maturities do not necessarily
reﬂect the timing of actual repayments or
cash ﬂow. In practice, certain assets and
liabilities behave differently from their
contractual terms, especially for short-term
customer accounts, credit card balances and
overdrafts, which extend to a longer period
than their contractual maturity. On the other
hand, mortgage balances tend to have a

1 Derivatives are on a discounted basis

The interest rate sensitivities are indicative
and based on simpliﬁed scenarios, estimating
the aggregate impact of an instantaneous
50bps parallel shock across all yield curves
over a one-year horizon, including the time
taken to implement changes to pricing
before becoming effective. The assessment
assumes that non-interest rate sensitive
aspects of the size and mix of the balance
sheet remain constant and that there are no
speciﬁc management actions in response to
the change in rates. No assumptions are
made in relation to the impact on credit
spreads in a changing rate environment.

Signiﬁcant modelling and behavioural
assumptions are made regarding scenario
simpliﬁcation, market competition, passthrough rates, asset and liability re-pricing
tenors, and price ﬂooring. In particular, the
assumption that interest rates of all currencies
and maturities shift by the same amount
concurrently, and that no actions are taken
to mitigate the impacts arising from this are
considered unlikely. Reported sensitivities
will vary over time due to a number of
factors including changes in balance sheet
composition, market conditions, customer
behaviour and risk management strategy
and should therefore not be considered an
income or proﬁt forecast.

RISK REVIEW

Risk proﬁle

As at 31 December 2018, the Group
estimates the one-year impact of an
instantaneous, parallel increase across all
yield curves of 50bps to be an earnings
beneﬁt of $210 million. The corresponding
impact from a parallel decrease of 50bps
would result in an earnings reduction of
$180 million.
The beneﬁt from rising interest rates is
primarily from reinvesting at higher yields and
from assets re-pricing faster and to a greater
extent than deposits. The current estimate
for US dollar sensitivity has reduced since
December 2017 on rising deposit sensitivity
to changes in interest rates.
The US dollar sensitivity is also impacted by
the dampening effect due to the asymmetry
of funding trading book assets with banking
book liabilities. The sensitivities include the
cost of banking book liabilities used to fund
the trading book, however the revenue
associated with the trading book positions
is recognised in net trading income.

This asymmetry in both the up and down
scenarios should be broadly offset within
total operating income.

Operational risk (unaudited)
Operational risks arise from the processes
executed within the Group. Risks associated
with these processes are mapped into a
Group Process Universe where the
standardised Control Assessment Standards
are applied. The standards are benchmarked
against regulatory requirements.
A summary of our operational risk
management approach is provided in the
Risk management approach (page 206).
Operational risk profle
The operational risk proﬁle is the Group’s
overall exposure to non-ﬁnancial risk, at a
given point in time, covering all Principal
Risk Types. The operational risk proﬁle
comprises both operational risk events
(including losses) and the current exposures
to non-ﬁnancial risks.

Operational risk events and losses
Operational losses are one indicator of
the effectiveness and robustness of the
non-ﬁnancial risk control environment. As at
31 December 2018, recorded operational
losses for 2018 are lower than 2017.
Operational losses in 2018 comprise
unrelated non-systemic events which
were not individually signiﬁcant.
Losses in 2017 include incremental
events that were recognised in 2018 and
reclassiﬁcation of Basel event types and
Basel business lines. As at 31 December
2018, the largest loss recorded for 2017
relates to an internal fraud loss of $21.7 million
in the Retail Banking Basel business line.
The Group’s proﬁle of operational loss
events in 2018 and 2017 is summarised in
the table below. It shows the percentage
distribution of gross operational losses by
Basel business line. This does not include
provision made for potential penalties relating
to US investigation, the FCA decision and
previously disclosed foreign trading issues,
which will be assessed when settled. Further
details are set out in Note 26 on page 305.

We will carry this momentum into 2019 as we
continue to roll out the ERMF and Risk Type
Frameworks across the Group, including
the branches and subsidiaries, as well as
launching training programmes to ensure
awareness and stakeholder engagement.

Directors’ report

The Enterprise Risk Management Framework
(ERMF), launched in January 2018, enables
the Group to manage enterprise-wide risks,
with the objective of maximising risk-adjusted
returns while remaining within our Risk
Appetite. The ERMF has been designed with
the explicit goal of improving the Group’s risk
management. Over the year, awareness of
the ERMF has increased signiﬁcantly and we
have made good progress in delivering the
key initiatives started in 2017 to embed the
framework across the organisation.

¼

Overseeing and challenging the
management of Principal Risk Types
under the ERMF

The independence of the Risk function
ensures that the necessary balance in
making risk and return decisions is not
compromised by short-term pressures to
generate revenues.
In addition, the Risk function is a centre of
excellence that provides specialist capabilities
of relevance to risk management processes
in the broader organisation.
The Risk function supports the Group’s
commitment to be Here for good by
building a sustainable framework that places
regulatory and compliance standards, and
a culture of appropriate conduct at the
forefront of the Group’s agenda in a manner
proportionate to the nature, scale and
complexity of the Group’s business.
As of 1st January 2019, we have rebranded
the Compliance function as Conduct,
Financial Crime and Compliance (CFCC),
reﬂecting the integration of the different areas
within the function, under the Management
Team leadership of the Group Head CFCC.

CFCC works alongside the Risk function,
within the framework of the ERMF, to deliver
an aligned Second Line of Defence.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

¼

Risk capacity is the maximum level of
risk the Group can assume, given its
current capabilities and resources, before
breaching constraints determined by
capital and liquidity requirements and
internal operational capability (including
but not limited to technical infrastructure,
risk management capabilities, expertise),
or otherwise failing to meet the
expectations of regulators and law
enforcement agencies.
Risk Appetite is deﬁned by the Group
and approved by the Board. It is the
maximum amount and type of risk the
Group is willing to assume in pursuit of
its strategy. Risk Appetite cannot exceed
risk capacity.

The Board has approved a Risk Appetite
Statement, which is underpinned by a set of
ﬁnancial and operational control parameters
known as Risk Appetite metrics and their
associated thresholds. These directly
constrain the aggregate risk exposures that
can be taken across the Group. The Risk
Appetite Statement is supplemented by an
overarching statement outlining the Group’s
Risk Appetite Principles.

Risk Appetite Principles
The Group Risk Appetite is deﬁned in
accordance with risk management principles
that inform our overall approach to risk
management and our risk culture. We follow
the highest ethical standards required by our
stakeholders and ensure a fair outcome for
our clients, as well as facilitating the effective
operation of ﬁnancial markets, while at the
same time meeting expectations of regulators
and law enforcement agencies. We set
our Risk Appetite to enable us to grow
sustainably and to avoid shocks to earnings
or our general ﬁnancial health, as well as
manage our Reputational Risk in a way
that does not materially undermine the
conﬁdence of our investors and all internal
and external stakeholders.
Risk Appetite Statement
The Group will not compromise adherence to
its Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue
growth or higher returns.
To keep the Group’s Risk proﬁle within Risk
Appetite (and therefore also risk capacity),
we have cascaded critical Group Risk
Appetite metrics across our Principal Risk
Types to countries with signiﬁcant business
operations. These are supplemented by risk
control tools such as granular level limits,
policies, standards and other operational
control parameters that are used to keep
the Group’s risk proﬁle within Risk Appetite.
The Group’s risk proﬁle is its overall exposure
to risk at a given point in time, covering all
applicable risk types. Status against Risk
Appetite is reported to the Board Risk
Committee and the Group Risk Committee,
including the status of breaches and
remediation plans where applicable. Country
Risk Appetite is managed at a country level
with Group and regional oversight.

Stress testing
The objective of stress testing is to support
the Group in assessing that it:

Risk identiﬁcation and
assessment

Does not have a portfolio with excessive
concentrations of risk that could produce
unacceptably high losses under severe but
plausible scenarios

¼

Has sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources to
withstand severe but plausible scenarios

¼

Has the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to respond to
extreme but plausible scenarios

¼

Understands the key business model
risks, considers what kind of event might
crystallise those risks – even if extreme
with a low likelihood of occurring – and
identiﬁes, as required, actions to mitigate
the likelihood or the impact

Stress tests are performed at Group,
country, business and portfolio level.
Bespoke scenarios are applied to our traded
and liquidity positions as described in the
sections on Traded Risk (page 202) and
Liquidity Risk (page 204). In addition to these,
our stress tests also focus on the potential
impact of macroeconomic, geopolitical and
physical events on relevant regions, client
segments and risk types.
The Board delegates approval of stress test
submissions to the Bank of England to the
Board Risk Committee who reviews the
recommendations from the Stress Testing
Committee. The Stress Testing Committee
is appointed by the Group Risk Committee
to review and challenge the stress test
scenarios, assumptions and results.
Based on the stress test results, the Group
Chief Risk Ofﬁcer and Group Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer can implement strategic actions to
ensure that the Group Strategy remains
within the Board-approved Risk Appetite.

Principal Risk Types

In 2018, through the development of the RTFs, we have revised the deﬁnition of certain Principal Risk Types to describe the risks or failures more
explicitly. In addition, Market Risk has been renamed to Traded Risk to encompass all sensitivities to traded price risk. Traded risk now includes
Market Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk, Issuer Risk, Valuation Adjustments, Pension Risk and Algorithmic Trading as risk sub-types. The table
below shows the Group’s current Principal Risk Types.
Deﬁnition

Credit Risk

¼

Potential for loss due to the failure of a counterparty to meet its agreed obligations to pay the Group

Country Risk

¼

Potential for losses due to political or economic events in a country

Traded Risk

¼

Potential for loss resulting from activities undertaken by the Group in ﬁnancial markets

Capital and Liquidity Risk

¼

Capital: potential for insufﬁcient level, composition or distribution of capital to support our normal activities
Liquidity: potential for loss where we may not have sufﬁcient stable or diverse sources of funding or
ﬁnancial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due

¼

Operational Risk

¼

Potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from
the impact of external events (including legal risks)

Reputational Risk

¼

Potential for damage to the franchise, resulting in loss of earnings or adverse impact on market
capitalisation because of stakeholders taking a negative view of the organisation, its actions or inactions
– leading stakeholders to change their behaviour

Compliance Risk

¼

Potential for penalties or loss to the Group or for an adverse impact to our clients, stakeholders or to the
integrity of the markets we operate in through a failure on our part to comply with laws or regulations

Conduct Risk

¼

Risk of detriment to the Group’s customers and clients, investors, shareholders, market integrity,
competition and counterparties or from the inappropriate supply of ﬁnancial services, including instances
of willful or negligent misconduct

Information and Cyber Security Risk

¼

Potential for loss from a breach of conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the Group’s information
systems and assets through cyber attack, insider activity, error or control failure

Financial Crime Risk

¼

Potential for legal or regulatory penalties, material ﬁnancial loss or reputational damage resulting
from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to international sanctions,
anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption

Supplementary information

Principal Risks Types

Financial statements

Principal Risk Types are risks that are inherent in our strategy and our business model and have been formally deﬁned in the Group’s ERMF.
These risks are managed through distinct Risk Type Frameworks (RTF) which are approved by the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer. The Principal Risk
Types and associated Risk Appetite Statements are approved by the Board.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Identiﬁcation and assessment of potentially
adverse risk events is an essential ﬁrst step in
managing the risks of any business or activity.
To ensure consistency in communication we
use Principal Risk Types to classify our risk
exposures. Nevertheless, we also recognise
the need to maintain an overall perspective
since a single transaction or activity may give
rise to multiple types of risk exposure, risk
concentrations may arise from multiple
exposures that are closely correlated, and a
given risk exposure may change its form from
one risk type to another.

¼

Enterprise stress tests include Capital and
Liquidity Adequacy Stress Tests, including in
the context of recovery and resolution, and
stress tests that assess scenarios where our
business model becomes unviable, such as
reverse stress tests.

Directors’ report

The individual Principal Risk Types’ Risk Appetite
Statements approved by the Board are set out in the
Principal Risks section (pages 198 to 212)

To facilitate the above, the Group maintains
a dynamic risk scanning process with inputs
on the internal and external risk environment,
as well as considering potential threats and
opportunities from the business and client
perspectives. The Group maintains an
inventory of the Principal Risk Types and
sub-types that are inherent to the strategy
and business model, near-term emerging
risks that can be measured and mitigated
to some extent, and uncertainties that are
longer-term matters that should be on the
radar but are not yet fully measurable.

Strategic report

The Group Risk Committee, the Group
Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Group
Non-Financial Risk Committee and the
Group Asset and Liability Committee are
responsible for ensuring that our risk proﬁle
is managed in compliance with the Risk
Appetite set by the Board. The Board Risk
Committee and the Board Financial Crime
Risk Committee (for Financial Crime
Compliance) advise the Board on the Risk
Appetite Statement and monitor the Group’s
compliance with it.

Further details of our principal risks and how these are being managed are set out in the Principal Risks section (pages 198 to 212)

RISK REVIEW

Risk management approach

¼

ERMF Effectiveness Reviews
The Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer is responsible
for annually afﬁrming the effectiveness of
the ERMF to the Board Risk Committee.
To facilitate this, an effectiveness review was
carried out which follows the principle of
evidence-based self-assessments, for all the
Risk Type Frameworks and relevant policies.
The ERMF Effectiveness Review conducted
in 2018 provides an objective baseline against
which progress can be measured over the
coming years. The 2018 Effectiveness
Review has shown that:
¼

The ERMF has been effectively designed
to improve the Group’s risk management
practices through mechanisms which
enable management to consistently
assess the risk management practices
across all risk types, proactively self-identify
gaps or improvement opportunities, and
develop action plans

¼

Through the framework, the Group is
now able to tangibly measure and
monitor effectiveness of its risk
management practices

Financial risks are managed more
effectively on a relative basis as compared
with the non-ﬁnancial risks reﬂecting the
maturity of these risk type frameworks

Over the course of 2019, the Group aims
to further strengthen its risk management
practices and work is underway to fully
embed the Risk Type Frameworks for the
non-ﬁnancial risks.

Executive and Board
risk oversight
Overview
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk
management and is supported by the six
Board-level committees. The Board approves
the ERMF based on the recommendation
from the Board Risk Committee, which also
recommends the Group Risk Appetite
Statement other than sections related to
Financial Crime Risk. Financial Crime Risk
Appetite is reviewed and recommended
to the Board by the Board Financial Crime
Risk Committee.

The Board appoints the Standard Chartered
Bank Court to maintain a sound system of
internal control and risk management. The
Group Risk Committee, through its authority
received from the Court, oversees effective
implementation of the ERMF. The Group
Chief Risk Ofﬁcer, as Chair of the Group
Risk Committee, approves the use of
sub-committees to support the Group
Risk Committee to ensure effective risk
management across the Group.
The Board Risk Committee receives regular
reports on risk management, including the
Group’s portfolio trends, policies and
standards, stress testing, and liquidity and
capital adequacy, and is authorised to
investigate or seek any information relating
to an activity within its terms of reference.
The Board Risk Committee also conducts
deep-dive reviews on a rolling basis of
different sections of the consolidated risk
information report that is provided at each
scheduled committee meeting.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

Group Risk Committee sub-committees
The Group Non-Financial Risk Committee,
chaired by the Group Head, Operational Risk,
was established in 2018 to replace the Group
Operational Risk Committee and ensures
effective management of inherent nonﬁnancial principal risks throughout the Group.
The non-ﬁnancial Principal Risk Types in
scope governed under the Group NonFinancial Risk Committee are Operational
Risk, Compliance Risk, Conduct Risk,
Information and Cyber Security Risk and
Reputational Risk that is consequential in
nature arising from the failure of all other
principal risks (secondary Reputational Risk).
The Committee also reviews and challenges
the adequacy of the internal control systems
across all Principal Risk Types.

The IFRS 9 Impairment Committee,
chaired by the Global Head, Enterprise
Risk Management, ensures the effective
management of expected credit loss
computation as well as stage allocation
of ﬁnancial assets for quarterly ﬁnancial
reporting within the authorities set by the
Group Risk Committee.

The Group Asset and Liability Committee is
chaired by the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
Its members are drawn principally from the
Management Team. The Committee is
responsible for determining the Group’s
approach to balance sheet management
and ensuring that, in executing the Group’s
strategy, the Group operates within internally
approved Risk Appetite and external
requirements relating to capital, liquidity and
leverage risk. It is also responsible for policies
relating to balance sheet management,
including management of our liquidity
and capital adequacy, structural foreign
exchange, interest rate and tax exposure.

Directors’ report

The Committee requests and receives
relevant information to fulﬁl its governance

RISK REVIEW

Risk management approach

Principal risks
We manage and control our Principal Risk Types through distinct Risk Type Frameworks,
policies and Board-approved Risk Appetite.

Credit Risk
The Group deﬁnes Credit Risk
as the potential for loss due to
the failure of a counterparty to
meet its agreed obligations to
pay the Group

Risk Appetite Statement

Roles and responsibilities

insurance, credit derivatives and guarantees.
The reliance that can be placed on risk
mitigants is carefully assessed in light of
issues such as legal certainty and
enforceability, market valuation, correlation
and counterparty risk of the protection
provider. The requirement for risk mitigation
is not a substitute for the ability to pay,
which is the primary consideration for any
lending decision.

The Credit Risk Type Frameworks for the
Group are set and owned by the Chief Risk
Ofﬁcers for the Corporate & Institutional
Banking, Commercial Banking, Private
Banking, and Retail Banking segments.
The Credit Risk function is the second line
control function responsible for independent
challenge, monitoring and oversight of the
Credit risk management practices of the
business and functions engaged in or
supporting revenue-generating activities,
which constitute the ﬁrst line of defence.
In addition, to ensure that credit risks are
properly assessed and are transparent,
credit decisions are controlled in accordance
with the Group’s Risk Appetite and credit
policies and standards.
Credit policies and standards are established
and approved by the Credit Risk Type
Framework owners or by individuals with
delegated authorities. Segment speciﬁc
policies are in place for the management
of Credit risk. For Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking, policies
address large exposures, credit initiation,
approval, monitoring, credit grading and
documentation. For Retail Banking, policies
address management of retail and business
banking lending, account and portfolio
monitoring, collections management and
forbearance programmes. In addition, there
are other Group-wide policies integral to
Credit Risk management such as those
relating to stress testing, risk measurement
and impairment provisioning.

Mitigation
The Group credit policies set out the key
considerations for eligibility, enforceability
and effectiveness of Credit Risk mitigation
arrangements. Potential credit losses from
any given account, client or portfolio are
mitigated using a range of tools such as
collateral, netting agreements, credit

198

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The Group manages its credit exposures following the principle
of diversiﬁcation across products, geographies, client segments
and industry sectors

Collateral types that are eligible as risk
mitigants include: cash; accounts receivable;
residential, commercial and industrial
property; ﬁxed assets such as motor vehicles,
aircraft, plant and machinery; marketable
securities; commodities; risk participations;
guarantees; derivatives; credit insurance;
and standby letters of credit. Physical
collateral, such as property, ﬁxed assets
and commodities, and ﬁnancial collateral
must be independently valued and an
active secondary resale market must exist.
The collateral must be valued prior to
drawdown and regularly thereafter as
required to reﬂect current market conditions,
the probability of recovery and the period of
time to realise the collateral in the event of
liquidation. Stress tests are performed on
changes in collateral values for key portfolios
to assist senior management in managing
the risks in those portfolios. The Group also
seeks to diversify its collateral holdings across
asset classes and markets.
Documentation must be held to enable the
Group to realise the collateral without the
cooperation of the obligor in the event that
this is necessary. For certain types of lending,
typically mortgages or asset ﬁnancing where
a ﬁrst charge over the risk mitigant must
be attained, the right to take charge over
physical assets is signiﬁcant in terms of
determining appropriate pricing and
recoverability in the event of default.
Physical collateral is required to be insured
at all times against risk of physical loss
or damage.

Where guarantees, credit insurance, standby
letters of credit or credit derivatives are used
as Credit Risk mitigation, the creditworthiness
of the protection provider is assessed and
monitored using the same credit approval
process applied to the obligor. The main
types of guarantors include banks, insurance
companies, parent companies, governments
and export credit agencies.

Governance committee
oversight
At the Board level, the Board Risk Committee
oversees the effective management of
Credit Risk.
At the executive level, the Group Risk
Committee appoints sub-committees for the
management of Credit Risk – in particular
the CCIBRC, the Private Banking Process
Governance and Risk Committee, and the
regional risk committees for Greater China
& North Asia, ASEAN & South Asia and
Africa & Middle East. These committees are
responsible for overseeing the Credit Risk
proﬁle of the Group within the respective
business areas and regions. Meetings are
held regularly and the committees monitor all
material Credit Risk exposures, as well as key
internal developments and external trends,
and ensure that appropriate action is taken.
The Group Risk Committee appoints
sub-committees for effective management of
enterprise stress testing, model governance
for Credit Risk, and approval of impairment
provisions computed under the IFRS 9
expected credit loss model to the Stress
Testing Committee, the Model Risk
Committee and the IFRS 9 Impairment
Committee respectively.

Risk measurement plays a central role,
along with judgement and experience,
in informing risk-taking and portfolio
management decisions. Since 1 January
2008, we have used the advanced internal
ratings-based approach under the Basel
regulatory framework to calculate Credit Risk
capital requirements.

Credit Risk committees meet regularly to
assess the impact of external events and
trends on the Group’s Credit Risk portfolios
and to deﬁne and implement our response in
terms of the appropriate changes to portfolio
shape, underwriting standards, risk policy
and procedures.

Advanced internal ratings-based models
cover a substantial majority of our exposures
and are used in assessing risks at a
customer and portfolio level, setting strategy
and optimising our risk-return decisions.
Material internal ratings-based risk
measurement models are approved by the
Model Risk Committee. Prior to review and
approval, all internal ratings-based models
are validated in detail by a model validation
team which is separate from the teams
that develop and maintain the models.
Models undergo annual validation by the
model validation team. Reviews are also
triggered if the performance of a model
deteriorates materially against predetermined
thresholds during the ongoing model
performance monitoring process which
takes place between the annual validations.

Supplementary information

For Retail Banking exposures, portfolio
delinquency trends are monitored on an
ongoing basis. Account monitoring is
based on behaviour scores and bureau
performance (where available). Accounts
that are past due (or perceived as high risk
and not yet past due) are subject to a
collections or recovery process managed
by a specialist function independent from
the origination function. In some countries,
aspects of collections and recovery activities
are outsourced.

Retail Banking internal ratings-based
portfolios use application and behavioural
credit scores that are calibrated to generate
a probability of default and then mapped to
the standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade
system. We refer to external ratings from
credit bureaus (where these are available);
however, we do not rely solely on these to
determine Retail Banking credit grades.

Financial statements

In Corporate & Institutional Banking and
Commercial Banking, clients or portfolios
are subjected to additional review when they
display signs of actual or potential weakness;
for example, where there is a decline in the
client’s position within the industry, ﬁnancial
deterioration, a breach of covenants,
non-performance of an obligation within the
stipulated period, or there are concerns
relating to ownership or management. Such
accounts and portfolios are subjected to a
dedicated process overseen by the Credit
Issues Committees in the relevant countries
where client account strategies and credit
grades are re-evaluated. In addition, remedial
actions are agreed and monitored. Remedial
actions include, but are not limited to,
exposure reduction, security enhancement,
exiting the account or immediate movement
of the account into the control of Group
Special Assets Management (GSAM), which
is our specialist recovery unit for Corporate
& Institutional Banking, Commercial
Banking and Private Banking that operates
independently from our main business.

A standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade
system is used for Corporate & Institutional
Banking and Commercial Banking. The
numeric grades run from 1 to 14 and some
of the grades are further sub-classiﬁed.
Lower numeric credit grades are indicative of
a lower likelihood of default. Credit Grades 1
to 12 are assigned to performing customers,
while Credit Grades 13 and 14 are assigned
to non-performing or defaulted customers.

RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW

All credit proposals are subject to a robust
Credit Risk assessment. It includes a
comprehensive evaluation of the client’s
credit quality, including willingness, ability
and capacity to repay. The primary lending
consideration is based on the client’s credit
quality and the repayment capacity from
operating cashﬂows for counterparties;
and personal income or wealth for individual
borrowers. The risk assessment gives due
consideration to the client’s liquidity and
leverage position. Where applicable, the
assessment includes a detailed analysis of
the Credit Risk mitigation arrangements
to determine the level of reliance on such
arrangements as the secondary source
of repayment in the event of a signiﬁcant
deterioration in a client’s credit quality
leading to default. Lending activities that are
considered as higher risk or non-standard are
subject to stricter minimum requirements and
require escalation to a senior credit ofﬁcer or
authorised senior executives for approval.

Credit rating and measurement

We regularly monitor credit exposures,
portfolio performance, and external trends
that may impact risk management outcomes.
Internal risk management reports that are
presented to risk committees contain
information on key political and economic
trends across major portfolios and countries;
portfolio delinquency and loan impairment
performance.

Directors’ report

The Credit Risk Type Frameworks are the
formal mechanism which delegate Credit
Risk authorities to individuals such as the
Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer, the segments’
Chief Risk Ofﬁcers and Global Heads of Risks
based on their abilities and management
responsibilities. Named individuals further
delegate credit authorities to individual credit
ofﬁcers by applying delegated credit authority
matrices by customer type or portfolio.
These matrices establish the maximum
limits that the delegated credit ofﬁcers are
authorised to approve, based on riskadjusted scales which take into account the
estimated maximum expected loss from
a given customer or portfolio. Credit Risk
authorities are reviewed at least annually to
ensure they remain appropriate. In Corporate
& Institutional Banking, Commercial Banking
and Private Banking, the individuals
delegating the Credit Risk authorities perform
oversight by reviewing a sample of the limit
applications approved by the delegated
credit ofﬁcers on a monthly basis. In Retail
Banking, credit decision systems and tools
(e.g. application scorecards) are used for
credit decisioning. Where manual credit
decisions are applied, these are subject to
periodic quality control assessment and
assurance checks.

Risk management approach

Credit concentration risk
Credit concentration risk may arise from a
single large exposure to a counterparty or
a group of connected counterparties, or
from multiple exposures across the portfolio
that are closely correlated. Large exposure
concentration risk is managed through
concentration limits set for a counterparty
or a group of connected counterparties
based on control and economic dependence
criteria. Risk Appetite metrics are set at
portfolio level and monitored to control
concentrations, where appropriate, by
industry, speciﬁc products, tenor,
collateralisation level, top 20 concentration
and exposure to holding companies.
Single name credit concentration thresholds
are set by client group depending on
credit grade, and by customer segment.
For concentrations that are material at
a Group level, breaches and potential
breaches are monitored by the respective
governance committees and reported to the
Group Risk and Board Risk Committees.

Credit impairment
Effective from 1 January 2018, we have
adopted the impairment requirements
of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, where
expected credit losses are determined for
all ﬁnancial assets that are classiﬁed as
amortised cost or fair value through other
comprehensive income. Expected credit
losses are computed as an unbiased,
probability-weighted amount determined by
evaluating a range of plausible outcomes,
the time value of money, and considering
all reasonable and supportable information
including that which is forward-looking.
When determining forward looking expected
credit losses, the Group also considers
a set of critical global or country-speciﬁc
macroeconomic variables that inﬂuence
Credit Risk. Global macroeconomic variables
include commodity prices such as crude oil,
commodity indices, bond indices and others
such as aircraft prices. Country-speciﬁc
macroeconomic variables include foreign
exchange rates, interest rates, ﬁscal
indicators like government spending and
government debt, country economic
indicators such as real GDP, unemployment
rate and consumer price indices, and
property indicators like residential
property indices.

200

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

At the time of origination or purchase of a
non-credit-impaired ﬁnancial asset (stage 1),
expected credit losses represent cash
shortfalls arising from possible default events
up to 12 months into the future from the
balance sheet date. Expected credit losses
continue to be determined on this basis until
there is a signiﬁcant increase in the Credit
Risk of the asset (stage 2), in which case, an
expected credit loss provision is recognised
for default events that may occur over the
lifetime of the asset. If there is observed
objective evidence of credit impairment or
default (stage 3), expected credit losses
continue to be measured on a lifetime basis.
The Group’s deﬁnition of default is aligned
with the regulatory deﬁnition of default as
set out in European Capital Requirements
Regulation (CRR178) and related guidelines,
where the obligor is at least 90 days past due
in respect of principal and/or interest. A loan
is considered past due (or delinquent), when
the customer has failed to make a principal or
interest payment in accordance with the loan
contract. Financial assets are also considered
to be credit-impaired where the obligors
are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of
one or more observable events that have a
detrimental impact on the estimated future
cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset.
In Corporate & Institutional Banking,
Commercial Banking and Private Banking,
a loan is considered credit-impaired where
analysis and review indicate that full payment
of either interest or principal, including the
timeliness of such payment, is questionable,
or as soon as payment of interest or principal
is 90 days overdue. These credit-impaired
accounts are managed by our specialist
recovery unit (GSAM).
In Retail Banking, a loan is considered
credit-impaired as soon as payment of
interest or principal is 90 days overdue
or meets other objective evidence of
impairment such as bankruptcy, debt
restructuring, fraud or death.
Financial assets are written off when there
is no realistic prospect of recovery and the
amount of loss has been determined. For
Retail Banking assets, a ﬁnancial asset is
written off when it meets certain threshold
conditions which are set at the point where
empirical evidence suggests that the client is
unlikely to meet their contractual obligations,
or a loss of principal is expected.

Estimating the amount and timing of future
recoveries involves signiﬁcant judgement, and
considers the assessment of matters such as
future economic conditions and the value of
collateral, for which there may not be a readily
accessible market. The total amount of the
Group’s impairment provision is inherently
uncertain, being sensitive to changes in
economic and credit conditions across
the regions in which the Group operates.
For more details on sensitivity analysis of
expected credit losses under IFRS 9, please
refer to page 177.

Stress testing
Stress testing is a forward-looking risk
management tool that constitutes a key
input into the identiﬁcation, monitoring
and mitigation of Credit Risk, as well as
contributing to Risk Appetite calibration.
Periodic stress tests are performed on
the credit portfolio/segment to anticipate
vulnerabilities from stressed conditions and
initiate timely right-sizing and mitigation plans.
Additionally, multiple enterprise-wide and
country-level stress tests are mandated by
regulators to assess the ability of the Group
and its subsidiaries to continue to meet their
capital requirements during a plausible,
adverse shock to the business. These
regulatory stress tests are conducted in line
with the principles stated in the Enterprise
Stress Testing Policy. The Group’s enterprise
stress testing programme adopted IFRS 9
in full in 2018 and all enterprise stress tests
conducted during 2018 were performed
on an IFRS 9 basis. Stress tests for key
portfolios are reviewed by the Credit Risk
Type Framework owners (or delegates) as
part of portfolio oversight; and matters
considered material to the Group are
escalated to the Group Chief Risk Ofﬁcer
and respective regional risk committees.

Roles and responsibilities

Decision-making authorities
and delegation
The Country Risk Type Framework is the
formal mechanism through which the
delegation of Country Risk authorities is
made. Decision-making and approval
authorities are guided by country capacity
levels, which are guidelines to set country
limits in respect of Country Risk. The capacity
levels are assessed by the Group Country
Risk function and are derived from factors
including: Group Tier 1 capital, transfer risk
grade, Group strategy, portfolio composition
(short and medium-term) and each country’s
total foreign currency earnings.

Stress testing
The Group Country Risk team produces
stressed Sovereign ratings which are used
by the relevant Credit and Traded Risk
teams in calculating risk-weighted assets
during described extreme but plausible
stress scenarios.

Supplementary information

Standards are developed and deployed to
implement requirements and controls that
all countries must follow to ensure effective
management of Country Risk. The standards
outline the process for Country Risk limit
setting, monitoring and reporting exposures.
In response to growing concerns over the
Country Risk outlook for a particular country,
sovereign ratings may be downgraded and
country limits may also be reduced.

At the Board level, the Board Risk Committee
oversees the effective management of
Country Risk. At the executive level, the
Group Risk Committee is responsible
for approving policies and control risk
parameters, monitoring material risk
exposures and directing appropriate action
in response to material risk issues or themes
that come to the Committee’s attention that
relate to Country Risk. At a country level, the
Country Risk Committee (or Executive Risk
Committee for subsidiaries) is responsible for
monitoring all risk issues for the respective
country, including Country Risk.

Monitoring
Monitoring and reporting of Country Risk is
included in the standards and covers the
monitoring of exposures relative to Risk
Appetite thresholds and limits, as well as
the reporting of material exposures to
internal committees and externally where
appropriate. The Group Risk Committee
monitors Risk Appetite thresholds on a
trafﬁc-light indicator basis, and these
provide an early warning signal of stress and
concentration risk. An escalation process to
the Board Risk Committee is in place based
on the trafﬁc-light indicators monitoring
system. In addition, the Group Risk
Committee and the Board Risk Committee
receive regular reports on Country Risk
exposures in excess of 1 per cent of total
Group assets.

RISK REVIEW

Risk management approach

Traded Risk
The Group deﬁnes Traded
Risk as the potential for loss
resulting from activities
undertaken by the Group
in ﬁnancial markets

Risk Appetite Statement

Under the Enterprise Risk Management
Framework, the introduction of the Traded
Risk Type Framework (TRTF) in 2018 sought
to bring together all risk types exhibiting risk
features common to Traded Risk.

TRM has a framework, policies and
standards in place ensuring that appropriate
Traded Risk limits are implemented. The
Group’s Traded Risk exposure is aligned with
its appetite for Traded Risk, and assessment
of potential losses that might be incurred by
the Group as a consequence of extreme but
plausible events.

These risk types include Market Risk,
Counterparty Credit Risk, Issuer Risk, XVA,
Algorithmic Trading and Pension Risk. Traded
Risk Management (TRM, formerly Market
and Traded Credit Risk) is the core risk
management function supporting marketfacing businesses, speciﬁcally Financial
Markets and Treasury Markets.

Roles and responsibilities
The TRTF, which sets the roles and
responsibilities in respect of Traded Risk for
the Group, is owned by the Global Head,
Traded Risk Management. The front ofﬁce,
acting as ﬁrst line of defence, are responsible
for the effective management of risks
within the scope of its direct organisational
responsibilities set by the Board. The TRM
function is the second line control function
that performs independent challenge,
monitoring and oversight of the Traded Risk
management practices of the ﬁrst line of
defence. The ﬁrst and second lines of
defence are supported by the organisation
structure, job descriptions and authorities
delegated by Traded Risk control owners.

Mitigation
The Group controls its trading portfolio and
activities to ensure that Traded Risk losses
(ﬁnancial or reputational) do not cause
material damage to the Group’s franchise by
assessing the various Traded Risk factors.
These are captured and analysed using
proprietary and custom-built analytical
tools, in addition to risk managers’ specialist
market and product knowledge.

202

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The Group should control its trading portfolio and activities to ensure
that Traded Risk losses (ﬁnancial or reputational) do not cause material
damage to the Group’s franchise

Traded Risk limits are applied as required
by the TRTF and related standards.
All businesses incurring Traded risk must do
so in compliance with the TRTF. The TRTF
requires that Traded Risk limits are deﬁned
at a level appropriate to ensure that the
Group remains within Traded Risk Appetite.
All exposures throughout the Group that the
TRM function is responsible for aggregate
up to TRM’s Group-level reporting.
This aggregation approach ensures that
the limits structure across the Group is
consistent with the Group’s Risk Appetite.
The TRTF and Enterprise Stress Testing
Policy ensure that adherence to stressrelated Risk Appetite metrics is achieved.
Stress testing aims at supplementing other
risk metrics used within the Group by
providing a forward-looking view of positions
and an assessment of their resilience to
stressed market conditions. Stress testing is
performed on all Group businesses with
Traded risk exposures, either where the risk is
actively traded or where material risk remains.
This additional information is used to inform
the management of the Traded risks taken
within the Group. The outcome of stress tests
is discussed across the various business
lines and management levels so that existing
and potential risks can be reviewed, and
related management actions can be decided
upon where appropriate.
Policies are reviewed and approved by the
Global Head, TRM annually to ensure their
ongoing effectiveness and sustainability.

Governance committee
oversight
At the Board level, the Board Risk Committee
oversees the effective management of
Traded Risk. At the executive level, the Group
Risk Committee delegates responsibilities
to the CCIBRC to act as the primary risk
governance body for Traded Risk, and to
the Stress Testing Committee for stress
testing and the Model Risk Committee for
model risk.

Decision-making authorities
and delegation
The Group’s Risk Appetite Statement, along
with the key associated Risk Appetite metrics,
is approved by the Board with responsibility
for Traded Risk limits, then tiered accordingly.
Subject to the Group’s Risk Appetite for
Traded Risk, the Group Risk Committee sets
Group-level Traded Risk limits, via delegation
to the GCRO. The GCRO delegates authority
for the supervision of major business limits to
the CRO, Corporate & Institutional Banking
and for all other Traded Risk limits to the
TRTF Owner (Global Head, TRM) who in turn
delegates approval authorities to individual
Traded Risk managers.
Additional limits are placed on speciﬁc
instruments, positions, and portfolio
concentrations where appropriate.
Authorities are reviewed at least annually
to ensure they remain appropriate and to
assess the quality of decisions taken by the
authorised person. Key risk-taking decisions
are made only by certain individuals with the
skills, judgement and perspective to ensure
that the Group’s control standards and
risk-return objectives are met. Authority
delegators are responsible for monitoring
the quality of the risk decisions taken by
their delegates and the ongoing suitability
of their authorities.

The Group applies VaR as a measure of the
risk of losses arising from future potential
adverse movements in market rates,
prices and volatilities. VaR, in general, is a
quantitative measure of Market Risk that
applies recent historical market conditions to
estimate the potential future loss in market
value that will not be exceeded in a set time
period at a set statistical conﬁdence level.
VaR provides a consistent measure that can
be applied across trading businesses and
products over time and can be set against
actual daily trading proﬁt and loss outcomes.

Credit Risk from traded products derives
from the positive mark-to market value of the
underlying instruments, and an additional
component to cater for potential future
market movements. This Counterparty
Credit Risk is managed within the Group’s
overall credit Risk Appetite for corporate and
ﬁnancial institutions. In addition to analysing
potential future movements, the Group
uses various single factor or multi-risk factor
stress test scenarios to identify and manage
Counterparty Credit Risk across derivatives
and securities ﬁnancing transactions.

VaR is calculated for expected movements
over a minimum of one business day and
to a conﬁdence level of 97.5 per cent.
VaR is calculated on our exposure as at
the close of business, generally UK time.
Intra-day risk levels may vary from those
reported at the end of the day.
The Group applies two VaR methodologies:
¼

In both methods, a historical observation
period of one year is chosen and applied.

To assess their ongoing performance, VaR
models are backtested against actual results.
An analysis of VaR and backtesting results in
2018 is available in the Risk proﬁle section
(pages 180 to 183).

The limits for the underwriting of securities
to be held for sale are approved by the
Underwriting Committee, under the authority
of the CCIBRC. The limits include the overall
size of the securities inventory, the maximum
holding period, the daily VaR, and sensitivities
to interest rate and credit spread moves.
The Underwriting Committee approves
individual proposals to underwrite new
security issues for our clients.

Stress testing is an integral part of the Traded
Risk management framework and considers
both historical market events and forwardlooking scenarios. A consistent stress testing
methodology is applied to trading and
non-trading books. The stress testing
methodology assumes that scope for
management action would be limited during
a stress event, reﬂecting the decrease in
market liquidity that often occurs.

Day-to-day Credit Risk management
activities for traded securities are carried
out by a specialist team within TRM whose
activities include oversight and approval
within the levels delegated by the
Underwriting Committee. Issuer credit risk,
including settlement and pre-settlement
risk, and price risks are controlled by TRM.
Where an underwritten security is held for
a period longer than the target sell-down
period, the ﬁnal decision on whether to sell
the position rests with TRM.

Stress scenarios are regularly updated to
reﬂect changes in risk proﬁle and economic
events. The TRM function reviews stress
testing results and, where necessary,
enforces reductions in overall Market Risk
exposure. The Group Risk Committee
considers the results of stress tests as part
of its supervision of Risk Appetite.

Monitoring
TRM monitors the overall portfolio risk and
ensures that it is within speciﬁed limits and
therefore Risk Appetite. The annual and
mid-year limit review processes provide
opportunities for the business and TRM
to review risk in light of performance.
Traded Risk exposures are monitored daily
against approved limits. Intra-day risk
exposures may vary from those reported at
the end of the day. Limit excess approval
decisions are informed by factors such as an
assessment of the returns that will result from
an incremental increase to the business risk
exposure. Limits and excesses can only be
approved by a Traded Risk manager with the
appropriate delegated authority. Financial
Markets traders may adjust their Traded Risk
exposures within approved limits and assess
risk and reward trade-offs according to
market conditions.

Regular stress test scenarios are applied
to interest rates, credit spreads, exchange
rates, commodity prices and equity prices.
This covers all asset classes in the Financial
Markets banking and trading books, including
XVA (CVA and FVA). Ad hoc scenarios are
also prepared, reﬂecting speciﬁc market
conditions and for particular concentrations
of risk that arise within the business.
Where required by local statute or regulation,
TRM’s Group and business-wide stress
and scenario testing will be supplemented
by entity stress testing at a country level.
This stress testing is coordinated at the
country level and subject to the relevant
local governance.

Supplementary information

A small proportion of Market Risk generated
by trading positions is not included in VaR or
cannot be appropriately captured by VaR.
This is recognised through a Risks-not-in-VaR
Framework, which estimates these risks and
applies capital add-ons.

Underwriting

The VaR measurement is complemented
by weekly stress testing of Market Risk
exposures to highlight the potential risk that
may arise from extreme market events that
are deemed rare but plausible.

Financial statements

Monte Carlo simulation: this methodology
is similar to historical simulation but with
considerably more input risk factor
observations. These are generated by
random sampling techniques, but the
results retain the essential variability and
correlations of historically observed risk

for some of the speciﬁc (credit spread) risk
VaR in relation to idiosyncratic exposures

Capital and Liquidity Risk
Risk Appetite Statement

The Group deﬁnes Capital Risk as
the potential for insufﬁcient level,
composition or distribution of capital
to support our normal activities,
and Liquidity Risk as the risk that
we may not have sufﬁcient stable or
diverse sources of funding to meet
our obligations as they fall due

Roles and responsibilities

Capital planning

The Treasurer is responsible for developing a
risk type framework for Capital and Liquidity
Risk and for complying with regulatory
requirements at a Group level. The Treasury
and Finance functions, as the Second Line of
Defence, provide independent challenge and
oversight of the ﬁrst line risk management
activities relating to Capital and Liquidity Risk.
In country, the Treasurer is supported by
Treasury and Finance in implementing the
Capital and Liquidity Risk Type Framework.

On an annual basis, strategic business
and capital plans are drawn up covering
a ﬁve-year horizon, and are approved by
the Board. The capital plan ensures that
adequate levels of capital, including loss
absorbing capacity, and an efﬁcient mix of
the different components of capital are
maintained to support our strategy and
business plans. Treasury is responsible for
the ongoing assessment of the demand
for capital and the updating of the Group’s
capital plan.

Mitigation
The Group develops policies to address
material Capital and Liquidity risks and aims
to maintain its risk proﬁle within Risk Appetite.
Risk Appetite is set for the Group and
cascaded down to the countries in the form
of limits and management action triggers.
The Group also maintains a Recovery Plan
which is a live document to be used by
management in a liquidity or solvency
stress. The Recovery Plan includes a set
of Recovery Indicators, an escalation
framework and a set of management actions
capable of being implemented in a stress.
A Recovery Plan is also maintained within
each major country.
The approach to mitigation is detailed
further below.

The Group should maintain a strong capital position including the
maintenance of management buffers sufﬁcient to support its strategic
aims and hold an adequate buffer of high-quality liquid assets to

¼

Available supply of capital and capital
raising options, including ongoing capital
accretion from the business

Structural FX risk
The Group’s structural position results from
the Group’s non-US dollar investment in the
share capital and reserves of subsidiaries
and branches. The FX translation gains or
losses are recorded in the Group’s Translation
Reserves with a direct impact on the Group’s
CET1 ratio.

The Group contracts hedges to manage its
structural FX position in accordance with a
Board-approved Risk Appetite, and as a
result the Group has taken net investment
hedges to partly cover its exposure to the
Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Taiwanese
dollar and Indian rupee to mitigate the FX
impact of such positions on its capital ratios.

Liquidity Risk
At Group and country level we implement
various business-as-usual and stress risk
metrics and monitor these against limits and
management action triggers. This ensures
that the Group maintains an adequate and
well-diversiﬁed liquidity buffer as well as a
stable funding base. A funding plan is also
developed for efﬁcient liquidity projection
to ensure that the Group is adequately
funded, in the required currencies, to meet
its obligations and client funding needs.
The approach to managing the risks and
the Board Risk Appetite is assessed
annually through the Internal Liquidity
Adequacy Assessment Process.

Interest rate risk in
banking book
The Group deﬁnes interest rate risk in the
banking book (IRRBB) as the potential for a
reduction in future earnings or economic
value due to changes in interest rates.
This risk arises from differences in the
re-pricing proﬁle, interest rate basis, and
optionality of banking book assets, liabilities
and off-balance sheet items. The Group
monitors IRRBB against a Board-approved
Risk Appetite.

Country oversight under the capital and
liquidity framework resides with country
Asset and Liability Committees. Countries
must ensure that they remain in compliance
with Group capital and liquidity policies
and practices, as well as local regulatory
requirements.

Stress testing and scenario analysis are
an integral part of the capital and liquidity
framework, and are used to ensure that the
Group’s internal assessment of capital and
liquidity considers the impact of extreme
but plausible scenarios on its risk proﬁle.
They provide an insight into the potential
impact of signiﬁcant adverse events on the
Group’s capital and liquidity position and how
this could be mitigated through appropriate
management actions to ensure the Group
remains within the approved Risk Appetite
and regulatory limits.

Roles and responsibilities

The CAS are used to determine the design
strength and reliability of each process,
and require:

The Operational Risk Type Framework
(ORTF) is set by the Group Head, Operational
Risk and is applicable enterprise-wide.
This Framework deﬁnes and collectively
groups operational risks which have not
been classiﬁed as Principal Risk Types into
non-Principal Risk Types (non-PRTs) and
sets standards for the identiﬁcation, control,
monitoring and treatment of risks. These
standards are applicable across all PRTs and
non-PRTs. The non-PRTs relate to execution
capability, fraud, corporate governance,
reporting and obligations, model, safety and
security, legal enforceability, and operational
resilience (including client service, third party
vendor services, change management,
and system availability).
The ORTF reinforces clear accountability
for managing risk throughout the Group
and delegates second line of defence
responsibilities to identiﬁed subject matter
experts. For each non-PRT, the expert sets
policies for the organisation to comply with,
and provides guidance, oversight and
challenge over the activities of the Group.
They ensure that key risk decisions are only
taken by individuals with the requisite skills,
judgement, and perspective to ensure that
the Group’s risk/return objectives are met.

Mitigation
The ORTF sets out the Group’s overall
approach to the management of Operational

At the Board level, the Board Risk Committee

Operational risk. At the executive level, the
Group Risk Committee delegates authority
primarily to the Group Non-Financial Risk
Committee (GNFRC) to monitor the Group’s
Operational Risk Appetite and to oversee the
Group’s Operational risk proﬁle. The GNFRC
has the authority to challenge, constrain and,
if required, stop business activities where
risks are not aligned with the Group’s
Operational Risk Appetite.
Regional, business segments and functionalcommittees also provide enterprise oversight
of their respective processes and related
operational risks. In addition, Country
Non-Financial Risk Committees (CNFRCs)
oversee the management of Operational risks
at the country (or entity) level. In smaller
countries, the responsibilities of the CNFRC
may be exercised directly by the Country Risk
Committee (for Branches) or Executive Risk
Committee (for Subsidiaries).

Monitoring
To deliver services to clients and to participate
in the ﬁnancial services sector, the Group
runs processes which are exposed to
operational risks. The Group prioritises
and manages risks which are signiﬁcant to
clients and to the ﬁnancial services sectors.
Control indicators are regularly monitored
to determine the residual risk the Group is
exposed to. The residual risk assessments
and reporting of events form the Group’s
Operational Risk proﬁle. The completeness
of the Operational Risk proﬁle ensures
appropriate prioritisation and timeliness of
risk decisions, including risk acceptances
with treatment plans for risks that exceed
acceptable thresholds.
The Board is informed on adherence to
Operational Risk Appetite through metrics
reported for selected risks. These metrics
are monitored and escalation thresholds
are devised based on the materiality and
signiﬁcance of the risk. These Operational
Risk Appetite metrics are consolidated on
a regular basis and reported at relevant
Group committees. This provides senior
management with the relevant information to
inform their risk decisions.

Stress testing
Stress testing and scenario analysis are used
to assess capital requirements for operational
risks. This approach considers the impact
of extreme but plausible scenarios on the
Group’s Operational Risk proﬁle. A number
of scenarios have been identiﬁed to test the
robustness of the Group’s processes, and
assess the potential impact on the Group.
These scenarios include anti-money
laundering, sanctions, information and
cyber security and external fraud.

The Group deﬁnes Reputational
Risk as the potential for damage
to the franchise, resulting in loss
of earnings or adverse impact
on market capitalisation
because of stakeholders
taking a negative view of the
organisation, its actions or
inactions – leading stakeholders
to change their behaviour

Risk Appetite Statement

Roles and responsibilities

Governance committee
oversight

Reputational Risk policies and standards
are applicable to all Group entities. However,
local regulators in some markets may impose
additional requirements on how banks
manage and track Reputational Risk. In such
cases, these are complied with in addition to
Group policies and standards. Exposure to
Reputational Risk is monitored through:
¼

A requirement that process owners
establish triggers to prompt consideration
of Reputational Risk and escalation
where necessary

¼

The tracking of risk acceptance decisions

¼

The tracking of thematic trends in
secondary risk arising from other
Principal Risk Types

¼

The analysis of prevailing stakeholder
concerns

The Group Reputational Risk Committee’s
remit is to:
¼

¼

¼

Challenge, constrain and, if required, stop
business activities where risks are not
aligned with the Group’s Risk Appetite
Make decisions on Reputational Risk
matters assessed as high or very high
based on the Group’s primary Reputational
Risk materiality assessment matrix, and
matters escalated from the regions or
client businesses
Provide oversight of material Reputational
Risk and/or thematic issues arising from
the potential failure of other risk types

The Group Non-Financial Risk Committee
has oversight of the effective management
of secondary Reputational Risk.

The Group Risk Committee provides
Group-wide oversight on Reputational
Risk, approves policy and monitors
material risks. The Group Reputational
Risk Committee is authorised to approve
or decline Reputational Risk aspects of any
business transaction, counterparty, client,
product, line of business and market within
the boundaries of the Group’s Risk Appetite,
and any limits and policies set by authorised
bodies of the Group.

Although Reputational Risk is not an explicit
separate regulatory factor in enterprise stress
tests, it is incorporated into the Group’s stress
testing scenarios. For example, the Group
may consider what impact a hypothetical
event leading to loss of conﬁdence among
liquidity providers in a particular market might
have, or what the implications might be for
supporting part of the organisation in order
to protect the brand.

Financial statements

The Group’s Reputational Risk policy sets out
the principal sources of Reputational Risk
and the responsibilities and procedures for
identifying, assessing and escalating primary
and secondary reputational risks. The policy
also deﬁnes the control and oversight
standards to effectively manage Reputational
Risk. The Group takes a structured approach
to the assessment of risks associated with
how individual client, transaction, product
and strategic coverage decisions may affect
perceptions of the organisation and its
activities. Wherever a potential for stakeholder
concerns is identiﬁed, issues are subject to
prior approval by a management authority
commensurate with the materiality of matters
being considered. Such authorities may
accept or decline the risk or impose
conditions upon proposals, to protect the
Group’s reputation. Secondary Reputational
Risk mitigation derives from the effective
management of other Principal Risk Types.

The Brand, Values and Conduct Committee
retains Board-level oversight responsibility
for Reputational Risk. Oversight from an
operational perspective falls under the remit
of the Group Risk Committee and the Board
Risk Committee. The Group Reputational
Risk Committee ensures the effective
management of primary Reputational Risk
across the Group.

Compliance Risk
The Group deﬁnes
Compliance Risk as potential

through a failure on our
part to comply with laws,
or regulations

Risk Appetite Statement

Roles and responsibilities

Mitigation

The Group Head, Conduct, Financial Crime
and Compliance (CFCC), as Risk Framework
Owner for Compliance Risk provides support
to senior management on regulatory and
compliance matters by:

The Compliance RTF sets the Group’s overall
approach to the management of Compliance
Risk. In support of this, the Compliance
function develops and deploys relevant
policies and standards setting out
requirements and controls for adherence by
the Group to ensure continued compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.
Through a combination of risk assessment,
control standard setting, control monitoring
and compliance review activities, the
Compliance Risk Framework Owner seeks
to ensure that all policies are operating as
expected to mitigate the risk that they cover.
The installation of appropriate processes and
controls is the primary tool for the mitigation
of Compliance Risk. In this, the requirements
of the Operational Risk Type Framework are
followed to ensure a consistent approach to
the management of processes and controls.

¼

Providing interpretation and advice on
regulatory requirements and their impact
on the Group;

¼

Setting enterprise-wide standards for
compliance, through the establishment
and maintenance of a risk-based
compliance framework, the Compliance
Risk Type Framework (Compliance RTF);

¼

Setting a programme for monitoring
Compliance Risk

The Compliance RTF sets out the roles and
responsibilities in respect of Compliance Risk
for the Group. All activities that the Group
engages in must be designed to comply with
the applicable laws and regulations in the
countries in which we operate. The CFCC
function is the Second Line of Defence
that ensures the overall operation of the
framework and for signiﬁcant areas of laws
and regulations, provides oversight and
challenge of the ﬁrst line risk management
activities that relate to Compliance Risk.
The Compliance RTF deﬁnes Compliance
Risk sub-types and, where relevant,
assigns responsibility for these to the most
appropriate other Principal Risk Type Owner
or control function. This ensures that effective
oversight and challenge of the ﬁrst line can
be provided by the appropriate second line
function. Each of these assigned second line
functions sets policies for the organisation
to comply with, and provides guidance,
oversight, and challenge over the activities
of the Bank. They ensure that key risk
decisions are only taken by individuals
with the requisite skills, judgement, and
perspective to ensure that the Group’s
Compliance Risk is appropriately managed.

The Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations; while
recognising that regulatory non-compliance cannot be entirely avoided,
the Group strives to reduce this to an absolute minimum

Governance committee
oversight
Compliance risk and the risk of noncompliance with laws and regulations
resulting from failed processes and controls
are overseen by Business, Product and
Function Non-Financial Risk Committees.
The Conduct and Compliance Non-Financial
Risk Committee has a consolidated view of
these risks, and ensures that appropriate
governance is in place for these. In addition,
the Committee ensures that elevated levels of
Compliance risk are reported to the Group
Non-Financial Risk Committee, Group Risk
Committee and Board Audit Committee.
Within each country, oversight of Compliance
Risk is delegated through the Country
Non-Financial Risk Committee where the
Operational Risk Control Assessment
Standards will form a primary part of the
monitoring of Compliance Risk.

Decision-making authorities

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The Group Head, CFCC has the authority to
delegate second line responsibilities within
the CFCC function to relevant and suitably
qualiﬁed individuals. In addition, second line
responsibilities, including policy development,
implementation and validation, as well as
oversight and challenge of ﬁrst line processes
and controls are delegated based on the
most appropriate other Principal Risk Type
or control function for certain compliance risk
sub-types.

Monitoring
The monitoring of controls designed to
mitigate the risk of regulatory non-compliance
in processes are governed in line with the
Operational Risk Type Framework. The
Group has a monitoring and reporting
process in place for Compliance Risk, which
includes the aggregation of compliance
exposures from across the Group and
escalation and reporting to Conduct and
Compliance Non-Financial Risk Committee,
Group Risk Committee and Board Risk
Committee as appropriate. In addition, there
is a Group Regulatory Reform team set up to
monitor regulatory reforms in key markets
and establish a protocol of horizon scanning
for emerging Compliance Risk. This protocol
ensures that regulatory reforms with the
potential to affect the Group in multiple
markets are identiﬁed and steps taken in
good time to ensure compliance with these.

Stress testing
Stress testing and scenario analysis are
used to assess capital requirements for
Compliance Risk and form part of the overall
scenario analysis portfolio managed under
the Operational Risk Type Framework.
Speciﬁc scenarios are developed annually
with collaboration between the business who
own and manage the risk and the CFCC
function who are second line to incorporate
signiﬁcant Compliance risk tail events.
This approach considers the impact of
extreme but plausible scenarios on the
Group’s Compliance Risk proﬁle.

The Group deﬁnes Conduct
Risk as the risk of detriment to
the Group’s customers and
clients, investors, shareholders,
market integrity, competition
and counterparties or from the
inappropriate supply of ﬁnancial
services, including instances of
wilful or negligent misconduct

Risk Appetite Statement

In addition to the Group’s external
stakeholders, Conduct Risk may also arise
in respect to our behaviour towards each
other as colleagues. The Group believes
that everyone is entitled to a fair and safe
working environment that is free from
discrimination, exploitation, bullying,
harassment or inappropriate language.

¼

The Compliance function as the second
line of defence and Risk Framework Owner
is responsible for challenging management

The Conduct Plans highlight the key
conduct risks that are inherent to the
processes and activities performed
or impacted within a country, region,
business or function

The Group strives to maintain the standards in our Code of Conduct and
outcomes of our Conduct Framework, by continuously demonstrating
that we are doing the right thing in the way we do business

Directors’ report

The Conduct Plan is a live document and
must be kept regularly updated, including
as and when there are potential or
materialised conduct risks identiﬁed
through other PRTs. Identiﬁed conduct
risks and the corresponding mitigation
should be monitored by relevant governance
committees to ensure effective and timely
resolution. The Conduct Plans should meet
minimum standards as follows:
¼

Conduct Plans are owned by the
management of each country, region,
business and function within the Group.
As the ﬁrst line of defence, management
is responsible to ensure that the Conduct
Plans are regularly reviewed and updated

¼

For each of the risks identiﬁed, appropriate
remediation action, enhancements to the
control environment, responsible action
owners and timeframes for resolution
must be clearly recorded within the
Conduct Plan

¼

Regular engagement should take place
between owners of the Group and
geographic Conduct Plans to ensure
appropriate escalation and
communications related to conduct risks
and the mitigation strategy applied

¼

Conduct Plans also reﬂect Conduct
Risks based on one-off projects, adverse
trends from conduct management
information, internal conduct incidents,

Committee and the Compliance Regulatory
Risk Committee are responsible for ensuring
that the Group effectively manages its
Conduct risk. As Risk Framework Owner
for Conduct Risk, Group Head, CFCC
sets reporting thresholds for escalation

Conduct Risk challenge and acceptance
authority is exercised by the Group Head,
CFCC and delegated within the CFCC
function as second line.

Monitoring and mitigation
The Compliance Assurance team perform
assurance reviews to monitor Conduct
Risk outcomes. In limited or special
circumstances, a speciﬁc thematic conduct
review may be performed. This may be
considered in scenarios where countries or
businesses have signiﬁcant and potentially
systemic Conduct Risk issues, which may
warrant a more focused assessment of the
end-to-end controls.
These reviews supplement other compliance
activities from a Second Line of Defence
perspective. These activities include
compliance stakeholder representation and
challenge at ﬁrst line governance committees
and conduct forums; surveillance activity –
such as trade surveillance, e-communication
surveillance, and sales and suitability
surveillance; Control Room management –
such as outside business interests, personal
account dealing, and information walls; and
validating or challenging the Group

Risk management approach

Information and Cyber Security Risk
The Group deﬁnes Information
and Cyber Security Risk as
the potential for loss from a
breach of conﬁdentiality,
integrity or availability of the
Group’s information systems
and assets through cyber
attack, insider activity, error
or control failure

Risk Appetite Statement

Roles and responsibilities

Mitigation

In 2018, the Group approved a Risk Type
Framework (RTF) to formally set out the
Group-wide strategy for managing
Information and Cyber Security (ICS) Risk.
The RTF has strengthened the role of the
business for managing ICS Risk. As a result,
through 2018 there has been signiﬁcant
expansion of ﬁrst line responsibilities to
ensure in-depth ownership and
understanding of ICS Risk by the ﬁrst line
of defence.

ICS Risk is managed through a structured
ICS Policy Framework comprised of a risk
assessment methodology and supporting
policies, procedures and standards which
are aligned to industry best practice models.

The RTF deﬁnes the ﬁrst line roles of
Information Asset Owners, Information
System Owners, and Information Custodians.
information asset owners and Information
System Owners are named individuals within
each business who have accountability
for classifying and managing risks to the
information assets and systems they own
respectively. Information Custodians are
named individuals, typically within the
Technology and Innovation (T&I) function,
responsible for providing secure processing
of information commensurate to the level
speciﬁed by the Information Asset or
Information System Owner. In addition, each
business and region has recruited Heads
of ICS to provide Information Asset and
System Owners a centralised ﬁrst line point
of contact to ensure controls are embedded
effectively and consistently across the Group.
The business, alongside T&I Security
Technology Services, is responsible for
remediation activities to strengthen the
Group’s ICS Risk controls to protect against
any new threats in an evolving environment.
The Chief Information Security Ofﬁcer (CISO)
has overall responsibility for strategy,
governance and oversight of ICS Risk across
the Group and operates as the second line
of defence. The CISO deﬁnes policy for
ICS Risk, overseeing and challenging the
operational implementation of controls at
the ﬁrst line.

210

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The Group seeks to avoid risk and uncertainty for our critical information
assets and systems and has a low appetite for material incidents
affecting these or the wider operations and reputation of the Group

Information Asset Owners, Information
System Owners, and Information Custodians
are responsible for compliance with the ICS
Policy Framework. This requires the ﬁrst line
to embed applicable ICS policy controls, and
measure the performance of these controls
with key indicators against thresholds set by
the Board. Additional controls may be added
by the business area to reﬂect any speciﬁc
characteristics of the reporting area which
may be relevant, depending on concurrence
from the CISO.
The CISO function monitors compliance
to the ICS Policy Framework through an
assessment of each key control domain
deﬁned by the ICS RTF through the Risk
proﬁle report. Within the risk proﬁle view,
appropriate mitigating activity for each key
control domain is identiﬁed, undertaken
and reported against by the business.
All business units, group functions, countries
and regions (Information Asset/System
Owner and Information Custodians)
complete a risk assessment of each relevant
key control domain for their operational
environment by completing a risk proﬁle.
These are submitted to the CISO and
to relevant governance committees for
continuous oversight and challenge
against Risk Appetite requirements.

Governance committee
oversight
The ICS Risk within the Group is currently
governed via the Board Risk Committee who
has responsibility for approving the deﬁnition
of ICS Risk and the Group Risk Appetite.
In addition, the Group Risk Committee
has delegated authority to the Group
Non-Financial Risk Committee (GNFRC)
to ensure effective implementation of the
ICS RTF. The GRC, and GNFRC retain
responsibility for oversight of ICS Risk
control domains rated very high and high
respectively. Sub-committees of the
GNFRC have oversight of the management
of ICS risks arising from business and
functional areas.
These governance committees have
responsibility for providing oversight of ICS
risks against Risk Appetite and measuring
performance of ICS Risk management
activities across the ﬁrst line. Chairs of
governance committees ensure adequate
representation for all business units and
countries across the Group who are
responsible for managing ICS Risk.
Escalation of risks which fall outside
the deﬁned appetite for the Group are
overseen by these committees to ensure
effective mitigation.

Decision-making authorities
and delegation
The ICS RTF is the formal mechanism
through which the delegation of ICS
Risk authorities is made. The GCRO
has delegated Risk Framework Owner
authority to the CISO. The CISO has,
where appropriate, delegated second line
authority to information security ofﬁcers to
assume the responsibilities for approval for
business, functions, and countries.
Approval of ICS Risk ratings follow an
approval matrix deﬁned by the ICS RTF
where the GCRO and CISO sign off very
high and high risks respectively.

Monitoring

ICS Risk proﬁle assessment exercise:
Risks to information assets and systems
must be identiﬁed using the approach
deﬁned within the RTF and a risk rating
ascertained. Risks identiﬁed within the
key control domains deﬁned in the RTF
are documented within risk proﬁles
and reviewed monthly as part of risk
governance to ensure effective mitigation
against the approved appetite. During
these reviews, the status of each risk is
assessed to identify any changes to
materiality and likelihood, which in turn
affect the overall risk score and rating.
Risks which exceed deﬁned thresholds
are escalated to appropriate governance
bodies. The CISO performs a consolidation
of completed risk proﬁles for the Group
and produces a holistic aggregated risk
position with appropriate key control and
risk indicators, which are used to govern
the overall ICS Risk

¼

Threat identiﬁcation: During the risk
identiﬁcation process, the CISO works
with the T&I function to ensure an accurate
threat proﬁle deﬁnition. Business areas
report on their threat proﬁle each month
to the Business, Product and Functional
level Non-Financial Risk Committees
ensuring continuous monitoring of threat
identiﬁcation. This is then reported to the
GNFRC, who reviews the reports at an
enterprise level. Improvements to the
Group’s threat intelligence capability are
being implemented through 2019

The Group deﬁnes Financial
Crime Risk as the potential for
legal or regulatory penalties,
material ﬁnancial loss or
reputational damage resulting
from the failure to comply with
applicable laws and regulations
relating to international sanctions,
anti-money laundering and
anti-bribery

Risk Appetite Statement

Roles and responsibilities

The Group operates risk-based controls
in support of its Financial Crime Risk
programme, including (but not limited to):

The Global Head, Conduct, Financial
Crime and Compliance (CFCC) has overall
responsibility for Financial Crime Risk and
is responsible for the establishment and
maintenance of effective systems and
controls to meet legal and regulatory
obligations in respect of Financial Crime Risk.
The Global Head, CFCC is the Group’s
Money-Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer and
performs the Financial Conduct Authority
controlled function and senior management
function in accordance with the requirements
set out by the Financial Conduct Authority,
including those set out in their handbook on
systems and controls.
As the ﬁrst line, the business unit process
owners have responsibility for the application
of policy controls and the identiﬁcation and
measurement of risks relating to ﬁnancial
crime. Business units must communicate
risks and any policy non-compliance to the
second line for review and approval following
the model for delegation of authority.

reports into the Group Risk Committee.
The Group Financial Crime Risk Committee
is responsible for ensuring the effective
management of Operational Risk relating to
Financial Crime Risk compliance throughout
the Group in support of the Group’s strategy
and in line with the Group’s Risk Appetite,
Enterprise Risk Management Framework
and Financial Crime Risk Type Framework.
The Board Financial Crime Risk Committee
is appointed by the Board, to provide
oversight of the effectiveness of the Group’s
policies, procedures, systems, controls and
assurance mechanism designed to identify,
assess, manage, monitor, detect or prevent
money laundering, non-compliance with
sanctions, bribery, corruption, and tax crime
by third parties.

Decision-making authorities
and delegation
The Global Head, CFCC is the Risk
Framework Owner for Financial Crime
Risk under the Group’s Enterprise Risk
Management Framework, and has delegated
authorities to effectively implement the
Financial Crime Risk Type Framework, to the
Co-Heads, Financial Crime Compliance.
Certain aspects of Financial Crime
Compliance, second line oversight and
challenge, are further delegated within the
CFCC function. Approval frameworks are in
place to allow for risk-based decisions on
client on-boarding, potential breaches of
sanctions regulation or policy, and situations
of potential anti-money laundering and
anti-bribery and corruption.

Monitoring
The Group monitors Financial Crime Risk
compliance against a set of Risk Appetite
metrics that are approved by the Board.
These metrics are reviewed periodically and
reported regularly to both the Group Financial
Crime Risk Committee and Board Financial
Crime Risk Committee.

Stress testing
The assessment of Financial Crime
vulnerabilities under stressed conditions
or extreme events with a low likelihood of
occurring is carried out through Enterprise
Stress Testing.

In addition to our Principal Risk Types that we manage through Risk Type Frameworks,
policies and Risk Appetite, we also maintain an inventory of our principal uncertainties.
Principal uncertainties refer to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes from certain
events which may have the potential to impact our business materially

Key changes to our principal uncertainties
The following item has been removed as a principal uncertainty:
¼

Korean peninsula geopolitical tensions – Due to the denuclearisation discussions relating to the Korean peninsula, we believe this risk
has decreased; however, we continue to conduct regular stress tests and assess contagion risks arising from risk levels and associated
contingency plans

Directors’ report

In 2018, we undertook a thorough review of our principal uncertainties, using the approach described in the Enterprise Risk Management
Framework section (pages 193 to 197). The key results of the review are detailed below.

Strategic report

Principal uncertainties

The following items have been amended or added as new principal uncertainties:
Extended trade tensions driven by geopolitics and trade imbalance – This risk was previously known as “Increase in trade protectionism
driven by nationalist agenda” and has been renamed to cover increasing concerns on potential trade tensions and the adoption of
protectionist policies

¼

China slowdown and impact on regional economies with close ties to China – This risk was previously known as “Moderation of growth
in key footprint markets led by China” and has been renamed to monitor and assess the impact from slowdown in China and associated
regional economies

¼

Emerging Markets – upcoming elections, interest rate rises and foreign exchange (FX) risks – This risk was previously known as “Sharp
interest rate rises and asset price corrections” and has been broadened to cover Emerging Market (EM) risks

¼

New technologies and digitisation – This risk has been split into two to adequately capture the opportunity or business disruption and
obsolescence risk from new technologies and increased data privacy and security risks respectively which could impact many elements
of banking

Risk heightened in 2018

Trade tensions between the United States and China
continue to rise driven by trade imbalance as well as
geopolitical tensions. The US imposed trade tariffs
on a further $200 billion of imports from China in
late September 2018 (China retaliated with tariffs on
$60 billion of goods). A 25% tariff may be imposed if
the two countries are unable to reach an agreement
which could start another round of devaluation
A full-ﬂedged and/or extended US–China trade
tensions could destabilise the world economy. The
adoption of protectionist policies driven by nationalist
agendas could disrupt established supply chains
and invoke retaliatory actions. Other countries could
introduce tariffs on goods and services available
domestically or from other economies. These would
impact global trade
The Group has a signiﬁcant revenue stream from
supporting cross-border trade

A sharp slowdown in world trade and global growth
is a feature of the Group stress scenarios including
the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
(ICAAP) and the annual Bank of England stress testing
exercise. These stress tests provide visibility to key
vulnerabilities so that management can implement
timely interventions

Financial statements

Based on our current knowledge and assumptions, our list of principal uncertainties is set out below, with our subjective assessment of their
impact, likelihood and velocity of change. This reﬂects the latest internal assessment of material risks that the Group faces as identiﬁed by senior
management. This list is not designed to be exhaustive and there may be additional risks which could materialise or have an adverse effect on
the Group. Our mitigation approach for these risks may not be successful in completely eliminating them, but rather shows the Group’s attempt
to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and materialise over time, management will take appropriate incremental steps based on
the materiality of the impact of the risk to the operations of the Group.

Qatar has adjusted to the trade and diplomatic
embargo by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
It is unlikely that the parties to the dispute will rush
to pursue a diplomatic solution which may leave a
lasting rift in the GCC
There is risk of escalation between Saudi Arabia and
Turkey as events surrounding the death of journalist
Jamal Kashoggi develop. The US congress is likely to
sustain pressure on Saudi Arabia despite the efforts
of the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia to
de-escalate
With US sanctions against Iran having come into
effect in November 2018, we anticipate that the
stand-off between Iran and Saudi Arabia will continue
The Group has a material presence across the region

¼

The exit of the UK from the European Union (EU)
(Brexit) could have implications on the economic
outlook for the eurozone and the UK, which might
in turn have global implications because of change
in policy direction. The uncertainties linked to the
Brexit negotiations process could delay corporate
investment decisions until there is more clarity
There continues to be uncertainty on UK’s exit
from Europe
The ﬁrst order impact of Brexit on the Group from a
Credit Risk or portfolio perspective is limited given
the nature of the Group’s activities. However, as
we have set up a new EU subsidiary, the operating
environment and client migration to the new
subsidiary are impacted given the uncertainty
on Brexit negotiations

There is constant monitoring at regional and country
level to detect horizon risks and analyse any potential
adverse developments. This included a planned
Strategy and Portfolio Review of Saudi Arabia in
November 2018

We continue to assess and manage post-Brexit risk
and the practical implications through the Brexit
Executive Committee chaired by a Management
Team member. We have also evaluated the potential
implications from a transition and will continue
monitoring the progress of the political negotiations
We have set up a new EU subsidiary and optimised
our EU structure to mitigate any potential impact to
our clients, our staff and the Group as a result of
Brexit, including loss of EU passporting rights. Set-up
activities are progressing well and we have obtained

Asia remains the main driver of global growth
supported by internal drivers, led by China
China’s economy has performed strongly since
the beginning of 2018. However key focus remains
on the government-led deleveraging efforts,
economic reforms, state owned enterprises,
and recent monitory policy actions to cut the
reserve requirements for most banks
Macroeconomic environment in the Greater
China/North Asia region is threatened by US-China
trade tensions
Highly trade oriented economies such as Hong Kong
and Singapore with close ties to China would
weaken in the event of an economic slowdown in
China. Regional supply chain economies such as
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia would be impacted from
a fall in economic activity
Greater China, North Asia and South-East Asian

We have participated, via a UN-led initiative, the United
Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative
(UNEP-FI), in the development of pilot scenario analysis
tools for physical and transition risks for energy utilities
clients and other high-emitting sectors. We are using
our experiences as we develop additional tools
We are also involved in a wide range of collaborative
initiatives related to climate risk management, as well
as opportunity identiﬁcation
We are working to develop tools to measure, manage
and ultimately reduce the emissions related to the
ﬁnancing of our clients
We have reduced our Risk Appetite to carbon-intensive
sectors by introducing technical standards for
coal-ﬁred power plants, and restrictions on new coal
mining clients and projects. These standards are
reviewed on a regular basis, and in September 2018
we announced that we would no longer provide
ﬁnancing for new coal-ﬁred power plants anywhere
in the world
We are developing a climate risk management
framework
We have made a public commitment to fund and
facilitate $4 billion toward clean technology between
2016 and 2020. In 2018, we funded $2.9 billion
taking us to a cumulative total of $4.9 billion since
January 2016

¼

National governments have, through the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) process and Paris Agreement, made
commitments to enact policies which support the
transition to a lower-carbon economy, limiting global
warming to less than 2ºC and therefore mitigating
the most severe physical effects of climate change
Such policies may, however, have signiﬁcant impacts,
for example, on energy infrastructure developed in
our markets, and thus present ‘transition’ risks for
our clients
Conversely, if governments fail to enact policies
which limit global warming, the Group’s markets are
particularly susceptible to ‘physical’ risks of climate
change such as droughts, ﬂoods, sea level change
and average temperature change
In September 2018, the Bank of England published a
report ‘Transition in thinking’ on practices in the UK
banking sector, ﬁnding that only 10 per cent of banks
were taking a strategic approach to climate change
This was followed by a PRA consultation paper
and draft supervisory statement in October 2018,
proposing signiﬁcant measures to be taken by banks
When the Group was reviewing its power generation
position statement in 2018, it received signiﬁcant
engagement on climate change from large investors
and civil society

EM equities ofﬁcially entered a bear market in
September 2018, following a 20 per cent decline
from their peak in January 2018. Many EM currencies
have weakened to multi-year lows against the
US dollar (examples: Indian rupee and South African
rand). South Africa also entered its ﬁrst recession
since the global ﬁnancial crisis
Such increases in interest rates and weakening of
local currencies in EMs could have an impact on
the highly leveraged corporate sector, as well as
countries with high current account deﬁcits or
high foreign currency share of domestic debt.
Property, commodities and asset prices would
also come under pressure
This could also adversely impact the credit quality
of the Group’s exposures, and our ability to reprice
these exposures in response to changes in the
interest rate environment
Of particular concern is the outlook for EMs,
speciﬁcally the risk of capital outﬂows and weakening
domestic currencies, with the associated increased
domestic political volatility. We see increased
political volatility, across EMs – like India, Nigeria,
Thailand and Sri Lanka – with upcoming elections

How these are mitigated/next steps

¼

The Group has been, and may continue to be,
subject to regulatory actions, reviews, requests for
information (including subpoenas and requests for
documents) and investigations across our markets,
the outcomes of which are generally difﬁcult to
predict and could be material to the Group
In recent years, authorities have exercised their
discretion to impose increasingly severe penalties on
ﬁnancial institutions in connection with violation of
laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance
that future penalties will not be of increased severity
The Group is also party to legal proceedings from
time to time, which may give rise to ﬁnancial losses
or adversely impact our reputation in the eyes of
our customers, investors and other stakeholders

¼

In July 2017, the CEO of the UK Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) announced that beyond 2021 the
FCA would no longer encourage panel banks to
submit quotes to LIBOR. While we do not submit to
LIBOR, LIBOR is heavily relied upon by the Group
as a reference rate, in various client products
and for enterprise-level processes and funding.
Regulators are trying to catalyse a voluntary
transition to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs)
Rules have been deﬁned in many key areas of
regulation that could impact our business model and
how we manage our capital and liquidity. In particular,
the upcoming Basel III proposed changes to capital
calculation methodology for Credit and Operational
risk, revised framework for securitisation and Credit
Valuation Adjustment risk, fundamental review of the
trading book, large exposures and implementation
of margin reforms, and bank recovery and resolution
directive for total loss absorbing capacity
Ongoing regulatory scrutiny and emphasis on local
responsibilities for remotely booked business. The
degree of reliance on global controls is reducing,
and the focus is on local controls and governance

Principal
uncertainties

New technologies have continued to gather
speed with a growing number of use cases
that address evolving customer expectations
In Retail Banking, we continue to observe
signiﬁcant shifts in customer value propositions
as markets deepen. Fintechs and existing
payment players are increasing digital-only
banking offerings to provide consumers with the
convenience of banking on-the-go. There is
growing usage of AI and machine learning to
personalise customer experiences, e.g. virtual
chatbots to provide digital ﬁnancial advice and
predictive analytics to cross-sell products.
In Corporate Banking, we observe an increasing
focus on process digitisation to boost cost
efﬁciencies. There are growing use cases for
blockchain technologies, e.g. to streamline
cross-border payments, automate Know Your
Customer compliance processes. AI and
machine learning have also been increasingly
used in predictive risk modelling, e.g. loan
default forecasts
Regulators are increasing emphasis on the
importance of resilient technology infrastructure
in terms of elimination of cyber risk and
improving reliability. The challenge is in renewing
the estate to reduce the risks presented by
obsolescence when the demands of ongoing
technology investment delivering into this tech
estate and its required performance levels
continue to rise signiﬁcantly.

¼

As digital technologies grow in sophistication
and become further embedded across the
banking and ﬁnancial services industry, the
potential impact proﬁle with regards to data risk
is changing. The cyber threat landscape is
evolving in terms of scope and pace. Banks may
become more susceptible to technology-related
data security risks as well as customer privacy.
The growing use of big data for analysis
purposes and cloud computing solutions are
examples of this
In addition, these risks represent an emerging
and topical theme both from a regulatory and
compliance perspective (i.e. the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) raises the proﬁle of
data protection compliance)
As the Group moves towards cloud computing
solutions, the increasing use of big data for
analysis purposes leads to increased
susceptibility to data security and customer
privacy risks

In 2017, the Group set up the SC Ventures unit to
spearhead bank-wide digital advancement. The unit is
gaining momentum to promote innovation, invest in
disruptive technologies and deliver client digital solutions.
SC Ventures focuses its activities in three key areas:
– Catalysts: Internal consulting team to support the
Group’s business units in problem-solving and
developing best practices in innovation
– Investments: Professional investment team to manage
the Group’s minority investments in third-party ﬁntechs
– Ventures: Venture management unit to sponsor and
oversee new wholly and partially owned ventures, with
a focus on disrupting business models in the Group’s
operating markets
The Group has continued to make headway in harnessing
new technologies to develop innovative solutions, e.g.
blockchain-based cross-border wallet remittance service
between Hong Kong and Philippines in partnership with
Ant Financial. We have also invested in new machine
learning technologies that rapidly analyse large datasets
and ﬁne-tune the accuracy of our ﬁnancial crime
surveillance tools
In addition, we are developing a framework to ensure
Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (FEAT) in
the Group’s usage of AI. We continue to deploy risk-minded
controls to ensure that all cloud-based services adhere to a
common governance model
We are actively targeting the reduction of obsolescent/end
of support technology following a Technology & Innovationled approach under the oversight of Risk Management and
the Group’s senior executives. The target is to address the
Group’s obsolescence risk, by evergreening and use of
new technologies such as the Cloud. In addition, we also
continue our client focus by delivering outage reductions,
enhanced protection by raising cyber defences and
efﬁciency by improvements to technology deployment
We have existing governance and control frameworks
for the deployment of new technologies and services
To manage the risks posed by rapidly evolving cyber
security threats and technology adoption, we have
designed a programme to focus on security improvements
and build a sustainable plan that will secure its information
and technology assets for the long term. The programme
is progressing with capability being built out in multiple
areas including governance, investment prioritisation and
execution risk management
We maintain a vigilant watch on legal and regulatory
developments in relation to data protection and customer
privacy to identify any potential impact to the business and
to implement appropriate mechanisms to control this risk
For the Group, GDPR principally impacts Group locations
and client segments in the EU, functions such as Human
Resources and downstream suppliers such as hubs and
external vendors that process personal data caught by the
GDPR (EU personal data). A GDPR programme has been
established to review and remediate vendor contracts and
intra-group agreements that involve the processing of EU
personal data

The Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital and Tier 1 leverage position were
ahead of both the current requirements and
the expected end-state requirements for
2019. For further detail see the Standard
Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures 2018
section on Capital.
The Group’s current Pillar 2A requirement
reduced in 2018 to 2.9 per cent of RWA, of
which at least 1.6 per cent must be held in
CET1. This requirement can vary over time.
The Group currently estimates its minimum
requirement for own funds and eligible
liabilities (MREL) at 21.8 per cent of RWA
from 1 January 2022. The Group’s combined
buffer (the capital conservation, global
systemically important institution (G-SII) and
countercyclical buffers) is additive, resulting in
a current estimate of its total loss absorbing
capacity requirement of 25.7 per cent of
RWA from 1 January 2022. The Group
estimates that its MREL position was
around 27.2 per cent of RWA and around
9.5 per cent of leverage exposure at
31 December 2018.
The Group continued its programme of
MREL issuance from its holding company
in 2018, issuing $5.0 billion of MREL eligible
securities across senior debt and Tier 2
during the period including the Group’s
inaugural issuance of US dollar callable senior
notes. As part of its proactive approach to
capital management, the Group successfully
conducted a liability management exercise to
buy back British pound sterling denominated
debt and improve the capital efﬁciency of the
non-equity capital stock.

Regulatory update
The European Commission has proposed
amendments to the Capital Requirements
Directive, the Capital Requirements
Regulation and the Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive. Any proposed reforms
remain subject to change and until the
proposals are in ﬁnal form it is uncertain
how they will affect the Group.
The Group remains a G-SII, with a
1.0 per cent G-SII CET1 buffer which phases
in at a rate of 0.25 per cent per year and
was fully implemented on 1 January 2019.
The Standard Chartered PLC 2017 G-SII
disclosure is published at: http://investors.
sc.com/fullyearresults
In line with previous guidance, the decrease
in the CET1 capital ratio on adoption of the
IFRS 9 accounting standard was around
13 basis points (bps) after considering the
offset against existing regulatory expected
losses. Under transitional rules, the day-one
impact on the CET1 ratio was negligible.
In the Bank of England’s 2018 stress tests,
under the hypothetical annual cyclical
scenario, the Group exceeded all hurdle
rates. The Group has a diverse and liquid
balance sheet and these results demonstrate
the Group’s continued capital strength and
increased resilience to stress.

Movements in risk-weighted assets
RWA decreased by $21.5 billion, or
7.7 per cent, from 31 December 2017 to
$258.3 billion. This was principally due to a
decrease in Credit Risk RWA of $15.1 billion,
or 6.7 per cent, and reductions in both
Market and Operational Risk RWA of
$3.9 billion and $2.4 billion respectively.
Corporate & Institutional Banking
Credit Risk RWA decreased by $12.4 billion
to $97.0 billion mainly due to:
¼

$3.5 billion decrease due to RWA
efﬁciencies, mainly $2.4 billion in Financial
Markets through novation, trade
compressions and process enhancement
in collateral recognition and $1.1 billion
of savings from RWA efﬁciency
initiatives on sovereign and ﬁnancial
institution exposures

¼

$3.3 billion decrease in model,
methodology and policy changes, mainly
due to $2.9 billion PRA-approved internal
ratings-based (IRB) model changes relating
to LGD parameters

¼

$2.1 billion decrease due to net credit
migration principally in ASEAN & South
Asia (ASA)

¼

$1.9 billion decrease from foreign
currency translation due to depreciation
of currencies in India, Europe and China
against the US dollar

¼

$1.5 billion RWA decrease from asset
balance reduction in Principal Finance

Market Risk
Total Market Risk RWA (MRWA) decreased
by $3.9 billion, or 17.1 per cent from
31 December 2017 to $19.1 billion. This
change was due mainly to reduced trading
book debt security holdings and to changes
in internal models approach (IMA) scope
and model.
Operational Risk
Operational Risk RWA reduced by $2.4 billion
to $28.1 billion, due to a decrease in the
average income over a rolling three-year time
horizon, as lower 2017 income replaced
higher 2014 income. This represents a
7.9 per cent year-on-year reduction in
Operational Risk RWA.

The Group’s UK leverage ratio, which excludes qualifying claims on central banks in accordance with a PRA waiver, was 5.6 per cent, which
is above the current minimum requirement of 3.6 per cent. The lower UK leverage ratio in the period was due to the combined impact of an
increased exposure measure and lower Tier 1 capital (end point).

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the ﬁnancial statements and
include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identiﬁed by us, including those which had
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit signiﬁcance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our
key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters
were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the ﬁnancial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters.

The risk

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Legal and regulatory
matters

Estimation uncertainty
There are a number of pending and ongoing legal disputes
and regulatory investigations involving the Group. In certain
litigation and regulatory matters signiﬁcant judgement is
required by the Group to determine whether a present
obligation exists and whether a provision should be
recognised. If there is a present obligation, there are
signiﬁcant judgements in determining the measurement
of provisions, which are subject to the future outcome of
legal or regulatory processes.

Our procedures included:

Refer to page 73 (Audit
Committee Report), page 304
(Note 24 Provisions for liabilities
and charges), page 304
(Note 25 Contingent liabilities
and commitments) and
page 305 (Note 26 Legal and
regulatory matters) including
accounting policies

Enquiry of lawyers: Meetings and correspondence
with the Group’s external counsel in the US and UK
and discussions with the PRA (who are in regular
contact with US and other regulatory bodies) to
understand the nature and status of legal disputes and
regulatory investigations in order to determine whether
or not a provision should be recognised.

Assessing transparency: Assessed whether
the disclosures related to signiﬁcant litigation and
regulatory matters adequately disclose the potential
liabilities and the signiﬁcant uncertainties that exist.

The value of provision liability recognised, for the legal and
regulatory matters above, has a high degree of estimation
uncertainty with a potential range of reasonable outcomes
greater than our materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a
whole.

Our results: We considered the provisions for
legal and regulatory matters recognised, including
the related disclosures and the contingent liability
disclosures made in Note 26, to be acceptable
(2017: acceptable).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amounts involved could be potentially signiﬁcant, and
the application of accounting standards to estimate the
expected outﬂow of any liability to be recognised is
inherently subjective.

Risk review and capital review

Assessing provisions and contingent liabilities:
We critically assessed and challenged the adequacy

greater levels of management judgement are:

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Our procedures included:
Control design, observation and operation: We tested the
design and operation of manual and automated controls over
the ECL including over:
¼

The assessment and calculation of material SICR indicators
and criteria

¼

The review and approval of the macroeconomic base case
used in the ECL calculation

¼

The independent model validation function

¼

The accuracy of critical data elements input into the system
used for credit grading and the approval of credit facilities;

¼

The completeness and accuracy of data ﬂows from source
systems into the ECL calculation

¼

The ongoing monitoring and identiﬁcation of loans displaying
indicators of impairment and whether they are migrating,
on a timely basis, to a watchlist (early alert) or to grades 12
to 14 (managed by Group Special Asset Management)

Assessing SICR thresholds: We have tested the
effectiveness of the SICR thresholds employed by the
Group across material retail and wholesale portfolios.

¼

Signiﬁcant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) –
the criteria selected to identify a SICR are highly
judgemental and can materially impact the
ECL recognised for certain portfolios where
the life of facilities is greater than 12 months

¼

Economic base case – IFRS 9 requires the
Group to measure ECL on a forward-looking
basis, incorporating future macro-economic
variables reﬂecting a range of future conditions.
The economic base case is the key driver of the
range of future conditions

Our economic scenario expertise: We involved KPMG
economic specialists to assist us in assessing the
appropriateness of the Group’s methodology for determining
the base case economic scenario for material macroeconomic
variables, and to challenge the base case forecast against
market consensus information.

¼

Complex ECL models – inherently judgemental
modelling techniques are used to estimate
ECLs which involves determining Probabilities
of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and
Exposure at Default (EAD). The PD model
used in the CIB portfolio is the key driver of the
Group’s overall ECL

Our ﬁnancial risk modelling expertise: We involved KPMG
ﬁnancial risk management modelling specialists to assist us
in assessing the appropriateness of material models within
the Group. For a sample of material models we assessed the
credit risk modelling approach, reperformed certain aspects of
the model build and independently evaluated model
performance results during the year.

¼

Qualitative adjustments – adjustments to
model-driven ECL results are raised to
address model limitations or emerging risks
and trends in underlying portfolios which are
inherently judgemental

Assessing qualitative adjustments to model-driven ECL:
We assessed the appropriateness of overlays to model-driven
ECL for CIB, CB and Retail by taking into account the
judgements and estimates the Group has made through the
ECL calculation process (including macroeconomic forecasts).
We also considered the performance of ECL models during the
year, assessed the appropriateness of proxies and impact of
assumptions used in the calculation.

¼

Individually assessed Stage 3 carrying value –
the carrying value of loans and advances to
banks and customers may be materially
misstated if individual impairments are not
appropriately identiﬁed and estimated. The
identiﬁcation of impaired assets and the
estimation of impairment including a range of
estimates of future cash ﬂows and valuation of
collateral

Assessing individual exposures: We selected a sample
(based on quantitative thresholds) of larger clients where
impairment indicators had been identiﬁed by the Group.
We obtained the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of
these exposures and challenged whether individual impairment
provisions, or lack of, were appropriate. This included the
following procedures:

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our
risk assessment, we determined that the value of
ECL has a high degree of estimation uncertainty,
with a potential range of reasonable outcomes
greater than our materiality for the ﬁnancial
statements as a whole. The ﬁnancial statements
(page 177) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the
Group.

Our response

¼

Challenged the different recovery scenarios identiﬁed
by the Group by comparing to external information
including publically available ﬁnancial performance and
sale agreements

¼

Challenged the probability weighting assigned to each
scenario by performing sensitivity analysis

¼

Assessed external collateral valuer’s credentials and
compared external valuations to values used in the
Group’s impairment assessments

Our results: We considered the credit impairment charge
and provision recognised and the related disclosures to be
acceptable (2017: acceptable).

Information technology

Control performance
The Group’s key ﬁnancial accounting and reporting
processes are highly dependent on the automated
controls over the Group’s IT systems. There is a risk
that gaps in the change management, segregation of
duties or user access management controls (in relation
to key ﬁnancial accounting and reporting systems) may
undermine our ability to place some reliance thereon in
our audit.

Our procedures included:

Refer to page 74 (Audit Committee
Report)

General IT controls design, observation and
operation: Tested a sample of key controls operating
over the information (in relation to ﬁnancial accounting
and reporting systems), including change
management, segregation of duties and user access
management controls.

Segregation of duties control operation: Tested a
sample of the automated controls (in relation to
ﬁnancial accounting and reporting systems) that are
designed to enforce appropriate segregation of duties.

Our results: We considered the change management
and segregation of duties controls in relation to
ﬁnancial accounting and reporting systems to be
acceptable (2017: acceptable).

Where relevant, evaluated alternative monitoring
controls that were performed by the Group

¼

Obtained and inspected the last log in dates of
users with privileged access, to identify whether
they accessed any ﬁnancial accounting and
reporting system during 2018

¼

Obtained and evaluated reports which assessed the
coding of the in scope applications to evaluate
whether any unauthorised changes have taken
place

¼

Assessed the nature of user IDs not subject to
monitoring controls to ascertain the level of privilege
and potential impact on ﬁnancial and reporting
systems

¼

Evaluated compensating controls, including

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our testing identiﬁed some weaknesses in the design
and operation of user access management controls.
As a result we expanded the extent of our testing by
performing a combination of testing of mitigating
controls and substantive testing to address control
weaknesses identiﬁed. Such additional procedures
included:

Risk review and capital review

User access management controls operation:
We obtained the Group’s evaluation of the access
rights, including privileged access rights, granted to
applications relevant to ﬁnancial accounting and
reporting systems and tested the resolution of a
sample of exceptions. We also assessed the operating
effectiveness of controls over granting, removal and
appropriateness of access rights, including privileged
access rights.

Directors’ report

Change management control operation:
Obtained and inspected the change management
policies and, for a sample of system changes during
the year (in relation to ﬁnancial accounting and
reporting systems), conﬁrmed that changes had been
performed in line with policy.

Valuation of ﬁnancial
instruments held at fair value
Fair value of level 3 asset positions
$2,581 million comprising
1.0% of total fair value ﬁnancial
instruments (1 January 2018:
$3,293 million, 1.4% and 2017:
$2,404 million, 1.6%)

Subjective estimate
The valuation of level 3 ﬁnancial instruments held at
fair value through proﬁt or loss or through other
comprehensive income may be misstated due to the
application of valuation techniques which often involve
the exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions
and estimates.

Our procedures included:

Fair value of level 3 liability positions
$1,046 million comprising 1.0% of
total fair value ﬁnancial instrument
liabilities (1 January 2018:
$536 million, 0.5% and 2017:
$536 million, 0.8%)
Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee
Report), page 275 (accounting policy)
and page 265 (Note 13 Financial
instruments)

A subjective estimate exists for instruments where
the valuation method uses signiﬁcant unobservable
inputs which is principally the case for level 3
ﬁnancial instruments.
Our work focused on the following:
¼

Identiﬁcation of level 3 positions

¼

Valuation of level 3 positions, including unlisted
investments in the Principal Finance business
and derivatives with signiﬁcant unobservable
pricing inputs

¼

Modelling of, and key inputs into, the valuation of
derivative and other instruments classiﬁed as level 3

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our
risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of
level 3 instruments has a high degree of estimation
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable
outcomes greater than our materiality for the ﬁnancial
statements as a whole. The ﬁnancial statements (page
288) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.

Annual Report 2018

Controls design, observation and operation:
We tested the Group’s controls over the identiﬁcation
and measurement of level 3 ﬁnancial instruments
including independent price veriﬁcation controls and
pricing inputs.
Methodology assessment: We assessed the
reasonableness of valuation methodology, model
calculation, inputs and assumptions used for a
selection of level 3 positions. This included considering
potential alternatives and sensitivities to key factors,
for example EBITDA and PE multiples for Principal
Finance investments.
Assessing completeness: We assessed the
methodology applied for the fair value hierarchy.
For a sample of level 2 and 3 ﬁnancial instruments
we challenged the appropriateness of the levelling
classiﬁcation. This included determining whether level
2 ﬁnancial instruments met the requisite criteria to be
classiﬁed as such.
Our results: We considered the valuation of level 3
ﬁnancial instruments held at fair value and the related
disclosures to be acceptable (2017: acceptable).

Our response

Goodwill impairment
Impairment: nil
(2016: $320 million)

Subjective estimate
Goodwill may be misstated if the carrying value of
goodwill in the balance sheet is not supported by
the estimated discounted future cash ﬂows of the
underlying businesses (the ‘value in use’).

Our procedures included:

Goodwill: $3,116 million
(2017: $3,252 million)
Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee
Report) and page 297 (Note 17
Goodwill and Intangible assets
including accounting policies)

The identiﬁcation of indicators of impairment and the
preparation of the estimate of recoverable amount
involves subjective judgements and uncertainties.

Our expertise: Our valuation specialists critically
assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates for
a sample of CGUs including those identiﬁed opposite,
independently calculating discount rate ranges using
external data sources and peer bank data for local
risk free rates, betas and market/country/entity
risk premiums.
Sensitivity analysis: Performing breakeven analysis
on the discount rate and the future cash ﬂows.
Historical comparison: Assessed the Group’s ability
to accurately prepare forecasts by comparing to
actual results.
Consistency comparison: Assessed the
consistency of projected cash ﬂows to the Board
approved corporate plan.

Risk review and capital review

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk
assessment, we determined that the value of in use
has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a
potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than
our materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole.
The ﬁnancial statements (page 298) disclose the
sensitivity estimated by the Group.

Benchmarking assumptions: For a sample of
CGUs, including those identiﬁed opposite, compared
the growth rate assumptions to externally derived data
for key inputs, including projected economic growth.
Directors’ report

Our work focused on cash generating units (CGUs)
which have low headroom or signiﬁcantly reduced
headroom, including:

Methodology assessment: Assessed whether the
segmentation of the CGUs, reﬂects our understanding
of the business and how it operates including
assessment of the independence of the underlying
cash ﬂows.

Strategic report

Key audit matter

Our results: We considered the goodwill impairment
recognised, the goodwill balance and the related
disclosures to be acceptable (2017: acceptable).

Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee
Report), page 320 (Note 32 Investment
in subsidiary undertakings, joint
ventures and associates including
accounting policies)

Recoverability of investment
The carrying value of the parent Company’s investment
in subsidiaries represents 54% (2017: 55%) of the
Company’s total assets. Recoverability of the
investment is not considered a high risk of signiﬁcant
misstatement or subject to signiﬁcant judgement.
However, due to the materiality of the investment in the
context of the parent Company ﬁnancial statements,
this is considered to be the area that had the greatest
focus of our overall parent Company audit.

Our procedures included:
Tests of detail: Compared the carrying amount of a
sample of the highest value investments, representing
99% (2017: 99%) of the total investment balance with
the relevant subsidiaries’ balance sheet to identify
whether their net assets, being an approximation of
their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of
their carrying amount and assessing whether those
subsidiaries have historically been proﬁt-making.

Supplementary information

Our results: We considered the Company’s
assessment of the recoverability of the investment
in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2017: acceptable).

Independent auditor’s report

3. Our application of materiality and an overview
of the scope of our audit
Materiality
Materiality for the Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole was set at
$120 million (2017: $100 million) with reference to a benchmark of
normalised proﬁt before tax for the year of $3,448 million (of which it
represents 3.5%). We have normalised the 2018 proﬁt before tax by
adding back the provisions for regulatory matters (see Note 2) as they
do not represent normal ongoing business and therefore the
benchmark adjusted for this is considered to be the most appropriate
benchmark to use. In the prior year we used 4.1% of proﬁt before tax
($2,415 million).
Materiality for the parent Company ﬁnancial statements as a whole
was set at $100 million (2017: $100 million), determined with reference
to a benchmark of net assets of $31,848 million (2017: $31,851 million),
of which it represents 0.3% (2017: 0.3%). We considered net assets
to be the most appropriate benchmark as the parent Company’s
balance sheet largely consist of investment in subsidiaries and
intergroup amounts.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or
uncorrected identiﬁed misstatements affecting Group proﬁt and loss
or Group shareholders’ funds exceeding $5 million (2017: $5 million)
and affecting Group assets or liabilities exceeding $50 million
(2017: $50 million), in addition to other identiﬁed misstatements
that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group team instructed component and hub auditors as to the
signiﬁcant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks and the
information to be reported to the Group team. The Group team
approved the component materiality levels, which ranged from
$1 million to $40 million (2017: $1 million to $40 million), having
regard to the size and risk proﬁle of the components.

Scope – general
The scoping of our audit is focused on those components which are
either individually signiﬁcant or contain signiﬁcant risks. Components
subject to speciﬁed audit procedures (as shown in the table opposite)
were not individually ﬁnancially signiﬁcant enough to require an audit
for Group reporting purposes, but were either scoped in on the basis
of the signiﬁcant volume of liquid assets and transactions processed
in those components or contained signiﬁcant risks which were
covered centrally.
The Group operates 9 (2017: 8) shared service centres, the outputs
of which are included in the ﬁnancial information of the reporting
components they service and therefore they are not separate
reporting components. All shared service centres where in-scope
ﬁnancial reporting processes are performed were subject to
speciﬁed audit procedures, primarily over transaction processing
and IT controls.

Team structure
As part of determining the scope and preparing the audit plan and
strategy, the Group team led a global planning conference to discuss
key audit risks and obtain input from component and hub teams.
Aside from the audit of the parent Company, consolidation, valuation
of ﬁnancial instruments, modelled expected credit losses, goodwill
impairment and material litigation and regulatory provisions all audit
work was performed by component or hub auditors.

232

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Aside from the site visits, regular conference calls were also held
with the component auditors. The Group team also inspected the
component teams’ key work papers related to the signiﬁcant risks and
assessed the appropriateness of conclusions and the consistency
between reported ﬁndings and work performed.

The Directors have prepared the ﬁnancial statements on the going
concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or the
Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that
the Company’s and the Group’s ﬁnancial position means that this
approach is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no
material uncertainties that could have cast signiﬁcant doubt over their
ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date
of approval of the ﬁnancial statements (‘the going concern period’).

Availability of funding and liquidity in the event of a market wide
stress scenario

¼

The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 126
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge

We have nothing to report in these respects, and we did not identify
going concern as a key audit matter.

5. We have nothing to report on the other
information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in
the Annual Report together with the ﬁnancial statements. Our opinion
on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and,
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether, based on our ﬁnancial statements audit work,
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the ﬁnancial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on
that work we have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the
other information.
Strategic report and Directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
¼

We have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the strategic report
and the Directors’ report

¼

In our opinion the information given in those reports for the ﬁnancial
year is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements

¼

In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 2006

Directors’ remuneration report
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.

Supplementary information

As these were risks that could potentially cast signiﬁcant doubt on the
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we
considered sensitivities over the level of available ﬁnancial resources
indicated by the Group’s ﬁnancial forecasts taking account of
reasonably possible (but not unrealistic) adverse effects that could
arise from these risks individually and collectively and evaluated the
achievability of the actions the Directors consider they would take to
improve the position should the risks materialise. We also considered
less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as those
included within the Bank’s recent stress tests, which could result in
a rapid reduction of available ﬁnancial resources.

¼

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In our evaluation of the Directors’ conclusions, we considered the
inherent risks to the Group’s and Company’s business model and
analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s
ﬁnancial resources or ability to continue operations over the going
concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely
affect the Group’s and Company’s available ﬁnancial resources over
this period were:

We have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to
the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements on
the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material
uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt over the Group and
Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months
from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements

Risk review and capital review

Our responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the
Directors’ conclusions and, had there been a material uncertainty
related to going concern, to make reference to that in this audit report.
However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as
subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with
judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the
absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report
is not a guarantee that the Group and the Company will continue
in operation.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Independent auditor’s report

Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our ﬁnancial statements
audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in
relation to:
¼

The Directors’ conﬁrmation within the Viability Statement on page
53 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its
business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity

¼

The Principal Risks disclosures on page 198 to 212 describing
these risks and explaining how they are being managed and
mitigated

¼

The Directors’ explanation in the Viability Statement of how they
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period
they have done so and why they considered that period to be
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing
attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only
the knowledge acquired during our ﬁnancial statements audit. As we
cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent
events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements
that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of
anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the
Group’s and Company’s longer-term viability.
Corporate governance disclosures
We are required to report to you if:
¼

We have identiﬁed material inconsistencies between the knowledge
we acquired during our ﬁnancial statements audit and the Directors’
statement that they consider that the annual report and ﬁnancial
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess
the Group’s position and performance, business model and
strategy

¼

The section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated
by us to the Audit Committee

We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed by the
Listing Rules for our review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.

6. We have nothing to report on the other matters
on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion:
¼

Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

¼

The parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns; or

¼

Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are
not made; or

¼

We have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 133,
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements including being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view;
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and
parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the
Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and
to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud,
other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually
or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
ﬁnancial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identiﬁed areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be
expected to have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements from
our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion
with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing
standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and
legal correspondence and discussed with the Directors and other
management the policies and procedures regarding compliance
with laws and regulations. We communicated identiﬁed laws and
regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any
indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included
communication from the group to component audit teams of
relevant laws and regulations identiﬁed at group level.
The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the ﬁnancial
statements varies considerably.

8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom
we owe our responsibilities

Risk review and capital review

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable
risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements
in the ﬁnancial statements, even though we have properly planned
and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.
For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions
reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.
In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance
and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws
and regulations.

Directors’ report

Secondly, the group is subject to many other laws and regulations
where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material
effect on amounts or disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements, for
instance through the imposition of ﬁnes or litigation or the loss of the
group’s licence to operate. We identiﬁed the following areas as those
most likely to have such an effect: regulatory capital and liquidity,
conduct, ﬁnancial crime including money laundering, sanctions list
and market abuse regulations recognising the ﬁnancial and regulated
nature of the group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required
audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and
regulations to enquiry of the Directors, and other management,
and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.
Further detail in respect of legal and regulatory matters is set out
in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.

Strategic report

Firstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect
the ﬁnancial statements including ﬁnancial reporting legislation
(including related companies legislation), distributable proﬁts legislation
and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance
with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the
related ﬁnancial statement items.

opening credit impairment provisions has been revised down by $222 million to $6,498 million, and the net expected credit loss of $(1,296) million adjusted against retained earnings

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
1. Accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate Standard Chartered
PLC (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
Group) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and
jointly controlled entities.
The parent company ﬁnancial statements present information about
the Company as a separate entity.
Both the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the Group
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved by the
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations
as endorsed by the European Union (EU). EU-endorsed IFRS may
differ from IFRS published by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB) if a standard has not been endorsed by the EU.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408
of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of
comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these
ﬁnancial statements.
The following parts of the Risk review and Capital review form part
of these ﬁnancial statements:
a) From the start of Risk proﬁle section (page 140) to the end of other
principal risks in the same section (page 192) excluding:

The consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost
convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation of cash-settled sharebased payments, fair value through other comprehensive income,
and ﬁnancial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value
through proﬁt or loss.
Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements
In determining the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities,
the Group makes assumptions of the effects of uncertain future
events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical
experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed
periodically. Further information about key assumptions concerning
the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty and
judgement, are set out in the relevant disclosure notes for the
following areas:
¼

Credit impairment (Note 8)

¼

Taxation (Note 10)

¼

IFRS and Hong Kong accounting requirements
As required by the Hong Kong Listing Rules, an explanation of the
differences in accounting practices between EU-endorsed IFRS
and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards is required to be
disclosed. There would be no signiﬁcant differences had these
accounts been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial
Reporting Standards.
Comparatives
Prior period comparatives are presented on an IAS 39 – Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement basis (Refer to the
31 December 2017 audited ﬁnancial statements for the IAS 39
accounting policies). Certain comparatives have been changed to
align with current year disclosures. The main changes are in respect
of IFRS 9 (see below).
Amortised cost reverse repurchase agreements and other similar
lending balances have been included with Loans and advances to
customers and Loans and advances to banks as appropriate.
In addition, the comparatives for commitments disclosed in Note 25
Contingent liabilities and commitments have been restated, as a
result of the availability of more reliable, centralised information
following the implementation of IFRS 9. The ageing of commitments
is now based on residual rather than original maturity. The Risk
proﬁle has similarly been updated. These changes have not resulted
in any amendments to the reported income statement or balance
sheet of the Group.

New accounting standards adopted by the Group
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
On 1 January 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial
Instruments, and the corresponding disclosure amendments to
IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures. IFRS 9 has been
endorsed by the EU, replaces IAS 39 and introduces; new
requirements for the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial
instruments; the recognition and measurement of credit
impairment provisions; and provides for a simpliﬁed approach
to hedge accounting.

¼

To continue to apply IAS 39 hedging requirements rather than
those of IFRS 9. Hedging disclosures have, however, been
updated to comply with new disclosure requirements

¼

To early adopt the ‘Prepayment Features with Negative
Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9)’ which was effective
1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted

¼

Not to restate comparative periods on the basis that it is not
possible to do so without the use of hindsight

The new IFRS 9 accounting policies are stated in the Risk review,
Note 8 Credit impairment and Note 13 Financial instruments.
Information on the transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 is stated in
Note 41.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
IFRIC 23 is effective from 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed
by the EU. It clariﬁes the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes
and is not expected to result in a material impact to the Group’s
ﬁnancial report.
Other amendments and clariﬁcations made to existing standards
that are not yet effective are not expected to result in a material
impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial report.

Supplementary information

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2018 and has been endorsed
by the EU, and replaces IAS 18 Revenue. IFRS 15 is conceptually
similar to IAS 18, but includes more granular guidance on how to
recognise and measure revenue, and also introduces additional
disclosure requirements. The Group performed an assessment
of the new standard and concluded that the current treatment of
revenue from contracts with customers is consistent with the new
principles and there is no material transitional impact.

The impact of IFRS 16 on the Group is primarily where the Group
is a lessee in property lease contracts. The Group has elected to
adopt the simpliﬁed approach of transition and will not restate
comparative information. On 1 January 2019 the Group will
recognise a lease liability, being the remaining lease payments
including extensions options where renewal is reasonably certain,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at the date
of initial application in the economic environment of the lease. The
corresponding right-of-use asset recognised will be the amount of
the lease liability adjusted by prepaid or accrued lease payments
related to those leases. Any difference will be recognised in retained
earnings at the date of initial application. The balance sheet increase
as a result of recognition of the lease liability and right-of-use asset
as of 1 January 2019 will be approximately $1.4 billion. However, the
actual impact may change as judgements and estimates are reﬁned.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group’s initial estimate of credit impairment provisions on
adoption of IFRS 9 was $6,720 million. Following reﬁnement of the
Group’s expected loss models, the estimate of the opening credit
impairment provisions has been revised down by $222 million to
$6,498 million, and the net expected credit loss of $(1,296) million
adjusted against retained earnings has similarly decreased by
$222 million to $(1,074) million. The relevant IFRS 9 disclosures in the
Risk review and in Note 41 Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
have been re-presented accordingly.

The signiﬁcant judgements in the implementation were determining
if a contact contained a lease, and the determination of whether
the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise extension options
present in lease contracts. The signiﬁcant estimates were the
determination of incremental borrowing rates in the respective
economic environments.

Risk review and capital review

The Risk proﬁle has been updated in accordance with the collateral
and credit enhancement requirements of IFRS 7 Financial
instruments: Disclosures, as amended for IFRS 9. The extent of
collateral as a mitigant has been determined with reference to both
the drawn and undrawn components of an exposure. Further, the
collateral balances align to the expected credit loss methodology
as this addresses the effects of collateral and other credit
enhancements on the amounts arising from expected credit losses.

New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective
IFRS 16 Leases
The effective date of IFRS 16 is 1 January 2019 and the standard
was endorsed by the EU in November 2017. IFRS 16 introduces
a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to
recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than
12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is
required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to
use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make lease payments. IFRS 16 substantially carries
forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17 Leases.
Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating
leases or ﬁnance leases, and to account for those two types of
leases differently.

Directors’ report

The Group has further chosen:

Going concern
These ﬁnancial statements were approved by the Board of directors
on 26 February 2019. The directors made an assessment of the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and conﬁrm they
are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
business for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval
of these ﬁnancial statements. For this reason, the Group continues
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the
ﬁnancial statements.

2. Segmental information
The Group’s segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8
Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal
performance framework and as presented to the Group’s
Management Team. The four client segments are Corporate &
Institutional Banking, Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Private
Banking. The four geographic regions are Greater China & North Asia,
ASEAN & South Asia, Africa & Middle East, and Europe & Americas.
Activities not directly related to a client segment and/or geographic
region are included in Central & other items. These mainly include
Corporate Centre costs, treasury markets, treasury activities, certain
strategic investments and the UK bank levy.
The following should also be noted:
¼

Transactions and funding between the segments are carried out
on an arm’s-length basis

¼

Corporate Centre costs represent stewardship and central
management services roles and activities that are not directly
attributable to business or country operations

¼

Treasury markets, joint ventures and associate investments are
managed in the regions and are included within the applicable
region. However, they are not managed directly by a client segment
and are therefore included in the Central & other items segment

¼

In addition to treasury activities, Corporate Centre costs and other
Group related functions, Central & other items for regions includes
globally run businesses or activities that are managed by the
client segments but not directly by geographic management.
These include Principal Finance and Portfolio Management

¼

The Group allocated central costs (excluding Corporate Centre
costs) relating to client segments and geographic regions using
appropriate business drivers (such as in proportion to the direct
cost base of each segment before allocation of indirect costs)
and these are reported within operating expenses

Basis of preparation
The analysis reﬂects how the client segments and geographic regions
are managed internally. This is described as the Management View
and is principally the location from which a client relationship is
managed, which may differ from where it is ﬁnancially booked and
may be shared between businesses and/or regions. In certain
instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financial View is
disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance
was booked. Typically the Financial View is used in areas such as
the Market and Liquidity risk reviews where actual booking location
is more important for an assessment. Segmental information is
therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.
Restructuring items excluded from underlying results
The Group has made a provision of $900 million for potential penalties
related to previously disclosed matters, namely, the US investigation
relating to historical violation of US sanctions laws and regulations,
the decision notice from the FCA concerning the Group’s historical
ﬁnancial crime controls and investigations relating to foreign exchange
trading issues. Further details of these and other legal and regulatory
matters can be found in Note 26 (on page 305).
The Group incurred net restructuring charges of $478 million in 2018
of which $375 million related to Principal Finance and included a
$160 million loss in the fourth quarter in respect of the announced
spin-out of the business and the sale of the majority of the Group’s
related investment portfolios to a third party. A further $155 million
related to planned initiatives to reduce ongoing costs and $34 million
related to the Group’s ship leasing business that the Group has
decided to discontinue. These gross charges were partly offset by
recoveries in relation to the liquidation portfolio.
A net gain of $69 million arose following the redemption of some
GBP-denominated securities.

all ﬁnancial liabilities held at amortised cost is recognised in proﬁt or loss using the effective interest method.
Interest income and expense on ﬁnancial instruments held at fair value through proﬁt or loss is recognised within net interest income using
the effective interest method, with the exception of fair value elected structured notes and structured deposits for which all gains and losses
are recognised within trading income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial asset or a ﬁnancial liability and of allocating the
interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash
payments or receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount
of the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash ﬂows considering all
contractual terms of the ﬁnancial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation
includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and
all other premiums or discounts. Where the estimates of cash ﬂows have been revised, the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset or liability
is adjusted to reﬂect the actual and revised cash ﬂows, discounted at the instruments original effective interest rate. The adjustment is
recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revision is made.
Interest income for ﬁnancial assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become
credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition (stage 3) and have had amounts written off, is recognised using the credit adjusted effective
interest rate. This rate is calculated in the same manner as the effective interest rate except that expected credit losses are included in the
expected cash ﬂows. Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the ﬁnancial asset including expected credit losses.
Should the credit risk on a stage 3 ﬁnancial asset improve such that the ﬁnancial asset is no longer considered credit-impaired, interest
income recognition reverts to a computation based on the rehabilitated gross carrying value of the ﬁnancial asset.

4. Net fees and commission
Accounting policy
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised on an accrual basis when the service has
been provided or signiﬁcant act performed.
Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and the Group retained no part of the loan
package for itself, or retained a part at the same effective interest rate as for the other participants.
The Group can act as trustee or in other ﬁduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts,
retirement beneﬁt plans and other institutions. The assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these ﬁnancial statements, as they
are not assets and income of the Group.

Transaction Banking
The Group recognises fee income associated with transactional Trade, Cash Management and Custody activities at the point in time the service
is provided. The Group recognises income associated with Trade contingent risk exposures (such as letters of credit and guarantees) and
periodic Custody activities over the period in which the service is provided.

Directors’ report

The determination of the services performed for the customer, the transaction price, and when the services are completed depends on the
nature of the product with the customer. The main considerations on income recognition by product are as follows:

Payment of fees is usually received at the same time the service is provided. In some cases, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Group
have annual upfront premiums, which are amortised on a straight-line basis to fee income over the year.

Syndication fees are recognised when the syndication is complete. Fees are generally received before completion of the syndication, or within
12 months of the transaction date.
Wealth Management
Commissions for bancassurance activities are recorded as they are earned. These commissions are received within a short time frame of the
commission being earned.
Target-linked fees are accrued over the period in which the target is met, provided it is assessed as highly probable that the target will be met.
Cash payment is received at a contractually speciﬁed date after achievement of a target has been conﬁrmed.

Risk review and capital review

Financial Markets and Corporate Finance
The Group recognises fee income at the point in time the service is provided. Fee income is recognised for a signiﬁcant non-lending service
when the transaction has been completed and the terms of the contract with the customer entitle the Group to the fee. Fees are usually received
shortly after the service is provided.

Upfront and trailing commissions for managed investment placements are recorded as they are conﬁrmed. Income from these activities is
relatively even throughout the period, and cash is usually received within a short time frame after the commission is earned.

Credit card annual fees are recognised at the time the fee is received since in most of our retail markets there are contractual circumstances
under which fees are waived, so income recognition is constrained until the uncertainties associated with the annual fee are resolved. The Group
defers the fair value of reward points on its credit card reward programmes, and recognises income and costs associated with fulﬁlling the
reward at the time of redemption.

The UK bank levy is applied on the chargeable equities and liabilities on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Key exclusions from
chargeable equities and liabilities include Tier 1 capital, insured or guaranteed retail deposits, repos secured on certain sovereign debt and
liabilities subject to netting. The rate of the levy for 2018 is 0.16 per cent for chargeable short-term liabilities, with a lower rate of 0.08 per cent
generally applied to chargeable equity and long-term liabilities (i.e. liabilities with a remaining maturity greater than one year). The rates will be
gradually reduced over the next two years, from 1 January 2021 they will be 0.10 per cent for short-term liabilities and 0.05 per cent for long-term
liabilities. In addition, the scope of the bank levy will be restricted to the balance sheet of UK operations only from that date.

8. Credit impairment
Accounting policy
Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
The Group’s expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions.
The signiﬁcant judgements in determining expected credit loss include:
¼

The Group’s criteria for assessing if there has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk; and

¼

Development of expected credit loss models, including the choice of inputs relating to macroeconomic variables

The calculation of credit impairment provisions also involves expert credit judgement to be applied by the credit risk management team
based upon counterparty information they receive from various sources including relationship managers and on external market information.
Details on the approach for determining expected credit loss can be found in the Credit risk section, under IFRS 9 Methodology (page 174).
Estimates of forecasts of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation can be found with in the Risk review,
Key assumptions and judgements in determining expected credit loss (page 175).
Expected credit losses
Expected credit losses are determined for all ﬁnancial debt instruments that are classiﬁed at amortised cost or fair value through other
comprehensive income, undrawn commitments and ﬁnancial guarantees.
An expected credit loss represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a ﬁnancial asset, undrawn
commitment or ﬁnancial guarantee.
A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash ﬂows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument and the
cash ﬂows that the Group expects to receive over the contractual life of the instrument.

254

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Measurement
Expected credit losses are computed as unbiased, probability-weighted amounts which are determined by evaluating a range of
reasonably possible outcomes, the time value of money, and considering all reasonable and supportable information including that which
is forward-looking.

Strategic report

8. Credit impairment continued

For material portfolios, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given
default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). There may be multiple default events over the lifetime of an instrument.
Further details on the components of PD, LGD and EAD are disclosed in the Credit risk section. For less material Retail Banking loan
portfolios, the Group has adopted simpliﬁed approaches based on historical roll rates or loss rates.

To account for the potential non-linearity in credit losses, multiple forward-looking scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably
possible outcomes for all material portfolios. For example, where there is a greater risk of downside credit losses than upside gains, multiple
forward-looking economic scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in respect of determining the PD
(and where relevant, the LGD and EAD) and in determining the overall expected credit loss amounts. These scenarios are determined using
a Monte Carlo approach centred around the Group’s most likely forecast of macroeconomic assumptions.

For credit-impaired ﬁnancial instruments, the estimate of cash shortfalls may require the use of expert credit judgement. As a practical
expedient, the Group may also measure credit impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
The estimate of expected cash shortfalls on a collateralised ﬁnancial instrument reﬂects the amount and timing of cash ﬂows that are
expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of obtaining and selling the collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is
deemed probable.
Cash ﬂows from unfunded credit enhancements held are included within the measurement of expected credit losses if they are part of, or
integral to, the contractual terms of the instrument (this includes ﬁnancial guarantees, unfunded risk participations and other non-derivative
credit insurance). Although non-integral credit enhancements do not impact the measurement of expected credit losses, a reimbursement
asset is recognised to the extent of the expected credit losses recorded.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash shortfalls are discounted using the effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated creditimpaired instruments (POCI) on the ﬁnancial instrument as calculated at initial recognition or if the instrument has a variable interest rate,
the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Risk review and capital review

The period over which cash shortfalls are determined is generally limited to the maximum contractual period for which the Group is exposed
to credit risk. However, for certain revolving credit facilities, which include credit cards or overdrafts, the Group’s exposure to credit risk is
not limited to the contractual period. For these instruments, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on the period that the Group is
exposed to credit risk, which includes the effect of credit risk management actions such as the withdrawal of undrawn facilities.

Directors’ report

Forward-looking economic assumptions are incorporated into the PD, LGD and EAD where relevant and where they inﬂuence credit risk,
such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, house price indices and commodity prices among others. These assumptions are incorporated
using the Group’s most likely forecast for a range of macroeconomic assumptions. These forecasts are determined using all reasonable and
supportable information, which includes both internally developed forecasts and those available externally, and are consistent with those
used for budgeting, forecasting and capital planning.

1 Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets do not attract an expected credit loss provision on initial recognition. An expected credit loss provision will be recognised only if
there is an increase in expected credit losses from that considered at initial recognition

3 Expected credit loss on loan commitments and ﬁnancial guarantees is recognised as a liability provision. Where a ﬁnancial instrument includes both a loan (i.e. ﬁnancial asset
component) and an undrawn commitment (i.e. loan commitment component), and it is not possible to separately identify the expected credit loss on these components, expected
credit loss amounts on the loan commitment are recognised together with expected credit loss amounts on the ﬁnancial asset. To the extent the combined expected credit loss
exceeds the gross carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset, the expected credit loss is recognised as a liability provision

Recognition
12 months expected credit losses (stage 1)
Expected credit losses are recognised at the time of initial recognition of a ﬁnancial instrument and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls
arising from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. Expected credit losses continue to be
determined on this basis until there is either a signiﬁcant increase in the credit risk of an instrument or the instrument becomes creditimpaired. If an instrument is no longer considered to exhibit a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk, expected credit losses will revert to being
determined on a 12-month basis.

Supplementary information

2 Debt and treasury securities classiﬁed as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are held at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The expected credit loss
attributed to these instruments is held as a separate reserve within other comprehensive income (OCI) and is recycled to the proﬁt and loss account along with any fair value
measurement gains or losses held within FVOCI when the applicable instruments are derecognised

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

8. Credit impairment continued
Signiﬁcant increase in credit risk (stage 2)
If a ﬁnancial asset experiences a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, an expected credit loss provision is
recognised for default events that may occur over the lifetime of the asset.
Signiﬁcant increase in credit risk is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at
origination (after taking into account the passage of time). Signiﬁcant does not mean statistically signiﬁcant nor is it assessed in the context of
changes in expected credit loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is signiﬁcant or not is assessed using a number of quantitative and
qualitative factors, the weight of which depends on the type of product and counterparty. Financial assets that are 30 or more days past due
and not credit-impaired will always be considered to have experienced a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios where
a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to compute expected credit loss, signiﬁcant increase in credit risk is primarily based on 30 days
past due.
Quantitative factors include an assessment of whether there has been signiﬁcant increase in the forward-looking probability of default (PD)
since origination. A forward-looking PD is one that is adjusted for future economic conditions to the extent these are correlated to changes
in credit risk. We compare the residual lifetime PD at the balance sheet date to the residual lifetime PD that was expected at the time of
origination for the same point in the term structure and determine whether both the absolute and relative change between the two exceeds
predetermined thresholds. To the extent that the differences between the measures of default outlined exceed the deﬁned thresholds, the
instrument is considered to have experienced a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk.
Qualitative factors assessed include those linked to current credit risk management processes, such as lending placed on non-purely
precautionary early alert (and subject to closer monitoring).
A non-purely precautionary early alert account is one which exhibits risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requiring closer
monitoring, supervision, or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower’s account, if left uncorrected, could result in
deterioration of repayment prospects and the likelihood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of position within
the industry, concerns over management’s ability to manage operations, weak/deteriorating operating results, liquidity strain and overdue
balances among other factors.
Credit-impaired (or defaulted) exposures (stage 3)
Financial assets that are credit-impaired (or in default) represent those that are at least 90 days past due in respect of principal and/or
interest. Financial assets are also considered to be credit-impaired where the obligors are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one or
more observable events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset. It may not be possible to
identify a single discrete event but instead the combined effect of several events may cause ﬁnancial assets to become credit-impaired.
Evidence that a ﬁnancial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:
¼

Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or borrower;

¼

Breach of contract such as default or a past due event;

¼

For economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s ﬁnancial difﬁculty, the lenders of the borrower have granted the borrower
concession/s that lenders would not otherwise consider. This would include forbearance actions (pages 160 to 162);

¼

Pending or actual bankruptcy or other ﬁnancial reorganisation to avoid or delay discharge of the borrower’s obligation/s;

¼

The disappearance of an active market for the applicable ﬁnancial asset due to ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the borrower;

¼

Purchase or origination of a ﬁnancial asset at a deep discount that reﬂects incurred credit losses

Irrevocable lending commitments to a credit-impaired obligor that have not yet been drawn down are also included within the stage 3 credit
impairment provision to the extent that the commitment cannot be withdrawn.
Loss provisions against credit-impaired ﬁnancial assets are determined based on an assessment of the recoverable cash ﬂows under a
range of scenarios, including the realisation of any collateral held where appropriate. The loss provisions held represent the difference
between the present value of the cash ﬂows expected to be recovered, discounted at the instrument’s original effective interest rate, and the
gross carrying value of the instrument prior to any credit impairment. The Group’s deﬁnition of default is aligned with the regulatory deﬁnition
of default as set out in European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR178) and related guidelines.

256

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Expert credit judgement
For Corporate & Institutional, Commercial and Private Banking, borrowers are graded by credit risk management on a credit grading (CG)
scale from CG1 to CG14. Once a borrower starts to exhibit credit deterioration, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing
book and when it is classiﬁed as CG12 the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will normally be performed by Group Special Assets
Management (GSAM).

Strategic report

8. Credit impairment continued

Borrowers graded CG12 exhibit well-deﬁned weaknesses in areas such as management and/or performance but there is no current
expectation of a loss of principal or interest. Where the impairment assessment indicates that there will be a loss of principal on a loan,
the borrower is graded a CG14 while borrowers of other credit-impaired loans are graded CG13. Instruments graded CG13 or CG14 are
regarded as non-performing loans, i.e. stage 3 or credit-impaired exposures.
Directors’ report

For individually signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assets within stage 3, GSAM will consider all judgements that have an impact on the expected future
cash ﬂows of the asset. These include: the business prospects, industry and geo political climate of the customer, quality of realisable value
of collateral, the Group’s legal position relative to other claimants and any renegotiation/ forbearance/ modiﬁcation options. The difference
between the loan carrying amount and the discounted expected future cash ﬂows will result in the stage 3 credit impairment amount.
The future cash ﬂow calculation involves signiﬁcant judgements and estimates. As new information becomes available and further
negotiations/forbearance measures are taken the estimates of the future cash ﬂows will be revised, and will have an impact on the future
cash ﬂow analysis.
For ﬁnancial assets which are not individually signiﬁcant, such as the Retail Banking portfolio or small business loans, which comprise
a large number of homogenous loans that share similar characteristics, statistical estimates and techniques are used, as well as credit
scoring analysis.

Techniques used to compute impairment amounts use models which analyse historical repayment and default rates over a time horizon.
Where various models are used, judgement is required to analyse the available information provided and select the appropriate model or
combination of models to use.
Expert credit judgement is also applied to determine whether any post-model adjustments are required for credit risk elements which are
not captured by the models.

Expected credit loss for modiﬁed ﬁnancial assets that have not been derecognised and are not considered to be credit-impaired will be
recognised on a 12-month basis, or a lifetime basis, if there is a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk. These assets are assessed to determine
whether there has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk subsequent to the modiﬁcation. Although loans may be modiﬁed for non-credit
reasons, a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk may occur. In addition to the recognition of modiﬁcation gains and losses, the revised carrying
value of modiﬁed ﬁnancial assets will impact the calculation of expected credit losses, with any increase or decrease in expected credit loss
recognised within impairment.

Forborne loans that have been modiﬁed (and not derecognised) on terms that are not consistent with those readily available in the market
and/or where we have granted a concession compared to the original terms of the loans are considered credit-impaired if there is a
detrimental impact on cash ﬂows. The modiﬁcation loss (see Classiﬁcation and measurement – Modiﬁcations) is recognised in the proﬁt
or loss within credit impairment and the gross carrying value of the loan reduced by the same amount. The modiﬁed loan is disclosed as
‘Loans subject to forbearance – credit-impaired’.

Supplementary information

Forborne loans
Forborne loans are those loans that have been modiﬁed in response to a customer’s ﬁnancial difﬁculties. Forbearance strategies assist
clients who are temporarily in ﬁnancial distress and are unable to meet their original contractual repayment terms. Forbearance can be
initiated by the client, the Group or a third-party including government sponsored programmes or a conglomerate of credit institutions.
Forbearance may include debt restructuring such as new repayment schedules, payment deferrals, tenor extensions, interest only payments,
lower interest rates, forgiveness of principal, interest or fees, or relaxation of loan covenants.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Modifed fnancial instruments
Where the original contractual terms of a ﬁnancial asset have been modiﬁed for credit reasons and the instrument has not been
derecognised (an instrument is derecognised when a modiﬁcation results in a change in cash ﬂows that the Group would consider
substantial), the resulting modiﬁcation loss is recognised within credit impairment in the income statement with a corresponding decrease in
the gross carrying value of the asset. If the modiﬁcation involved a concession that the bank would not otherwise consider, the instrument is
considered to be credit-impaired and is considered forborne.

Risk review and capital review

Retail Banking clients are considered credit-impaired where they are more than 90 days past due. Retail Banking products are also
considered credit-impaired if the borrower ﬁles for bankruptcy or other forbearance programme, the borrower is deceased or the business is
closed in the case of a small business, or if the borrower surrenders the collateral, or there is an identiﬁed fraud on the account. Additionally,
if the account is unsecured and the borrower has other credit accounts with the Group that are considered credit-impaired, the account may
be also be credit-impaired.

Loans that have been subject to a forbearance modiﬁcation, but which are not considered credit-impaired (not classiﬁed as CG13 or CG14),
are disclosed as ‘Forborne – not credit-impaired’. This may include amendments to covenants within the contractual terms.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

8. Credit impairment continued
Write-offs of credit-impaired instruments and reversal of impairment
To the extent a ﬁnancial debt instrument is considered irrecoverable, the applicable portion of the gross carrying value is written off against
the related loan provision. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed, it is decided that there is no
realistic probability of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off
decrease the amount of the provision for loan impairment in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the credit
impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the credit impairment was recognised
(such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognised credit impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the provision
account. The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Loss provisions on purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments (POCI)
The Group measures expected credit loss on a lifetime basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, expected
credit loss is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is
inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Group recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising
subsequent to initial recognition in the income statement and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime expected credit
losses on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favourable differences are recognised as impairment gains in
the income statement (and as impairment loss where the expected credit losses are greater).
Improvement in credit risk/curing
A period may elapse from the point at which instruments enter lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 or stage 3) and are reclassiﬁed back
to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). For ﬁnancial assets that are credit-impaired (stage 3), a transfer to stage 2 or stage 1 is only
permitted where the instrument is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. An instrument will no longer be considered credit-impaired
when there is no shortfall of cash ﬂows compared to the original contractual terms.
For ﬁnancial assets within stage 2, these can only be transferred to stage 1 when they are no longer considered to have experienced a
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk.
Where signiﬁcant increase in credit risk was determined using quantitative measures, the instruments will automatically transfer back to stage
1 when the original PD based transfer criteria are no longer met. Where instruments were transferred to stage 2 due to an assessment of
qualitative factors, the issues that led to the reclassiﬁcation must be cured before the instruments can be reclassiﬁed to stage 1. This includes
instances where management actions led to instruments being classiﬁed as stage 2, requiring that action to be resolved before loans are
reclassiﬁed to stage 1.
A forborne loan can only be removed from the disclosure (cured) if the loan is performing (stage 1 or 2) and a further two-year probation
period is met.
In order for a forborne loan to become performing, the following criteria have to be satisﬁed:
¼

At least a year has passed with no default based upon the forborne contract terms

¼

The customer is likely to repay its obligations in full without realising security

¼

The customer has no accumulated impairment against amount outstanding

Subsequent to the criteria above, a further two-year probation period has to be fulﬁlled, whereby regular payments are made by the
customer and none of the exposures to the customer are more than 30 days past due.

10. Taxation
Accounting policy
Income tax payable on proﬁts is based on the applicable tax law in each jurisdiction and is recognised as an expense in the period in which
proﬁts arise.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as
at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability
is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences can
be utilised. Where permitted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.

Directors’ report

Current and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is
subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.
Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
¼ Determining the Group’s tax charge for the year involves estimation and judgement, which includes an interpretation of local tax laws and
an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken. These judgements take account of external advice where
appropriate, and the Group’s view on settling with the relevant tax authorities
¼

The Group provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorities where an
outﬂow is probable. In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorities will examine all the amounts reported to them and
have full knowledge of all relevant information

¼

The recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets is based on management’s judgement of the availability of future taxable proﬁts

The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective 1 January 2018, reduced the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent and
introduced a Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax. The combined impact of these changes in the tax rates reduced the 2017 US deferred tax
asset, increasing the 2017 deferred tax charge by $220 million.
The tax charge for the year of $1,439 million (31 December 2017: $1,147 million) on a proﬁt before tax of $2,548 million (31 December 2017:
$2,415 million) reﬂects the impact of non-deductible regulatory provisions and other non-deductible expenses, non-creditable withholding taxes
and the impact of countries with tax rates higher or lower than the UK, the most signiﬁcant of which is India.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years: The Group’s tax charge, and effective tax rate in future years could be affected by several
factors including acquisitions, disposals and restructuring of our businesses, the mix of proﬁts across jurisdictions with different statutory tax
rates, changes in tax legislation and tax rates and resolution of uncertain tax positions.
The evaluation of uncertain tax positions involves an interpretation of local tax laws which could be subject to challenge by a tax authority,
and an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken. The Group does not currently consider that assumptions
or judgements made in assessing tax liabilities have a signiﬁcant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next ﬁnancial year.

Other temporary differences

At 31 December 2018, the Group has net deferred tax assets of $484 million (31 December 2017: $773 million). The recoverability of the Group’s
deferred tax assets is based on management’s judgement of the availability of future taxable proﬁts against which the deferred tax assets will
be utilised.
Of the Group’s total deferred tax assets, $266 million relates to tax losses carried forward. These tax losses have arisen in individual legal entities
and will be offset as future taxable proﬁts arise in those entities.
¼

$139 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Ireland, where there is no expiry date for unused tax losses. These
losses relate to aircraft leasing and are expected to be fully utilised over the useful economical life of the assets being up to 18 years

¼

$33 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Korea. These losses have no expiry date, and there is a deﬁned proﬁt
stream against which they are forecast to be utilised

¼

$27 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in the US. Management forecasts show that the losses are expected to be
fully utilised over a period of nine years. The tax losses expire after 20 years

¼

$25 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Taiwan. Management forecasts show that the losses are expected to be
fully utilised over a period of one year. The tax losses expire after 10 years

The remaining deferred tax assets of $42 million relating to losses has arisen in other jurisdictions and is expected to be recovered in less than
10 years.

investment transactions driven by strategic intent; and other infrequent and/or exceptional transactions that are signiﬁcant or material in
the context of the Group’s normal business earnings for the period.

Classiﬁcation and measurement
Accounting policy
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive
income; and fair value through proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as either amortised cost, or held at fair value through proﬁt or
loss. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at initial recognition of the instrument or, where applicable,
at the time of reclassiﬁcation.

In assessing whether the contractual cash ﬂows have SPPI characteristics, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.
This includes assessing whether the ﬁnancial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash ﬂows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:
Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash ﬂows

¼

Leverage features

¼

Prepayment and extension terms

¼

Terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash ﬂows from speciﬁed assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and

¼

Features that modify consideration of the time value of money – e.g. periodical reset of interest rates

Whether ﬁnancial assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depend on the objectives of the business models under which the assets
are held. A business model refers to how the Group manages ﬁnancial assets to generate cash ﬂows.
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at the individual product business line
and, where applicable, within business lines depending on the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.
Factors considered include:
How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management

¼

How managers of the business model are compensated, including whether management is compensated based on the fair value of
assets or the contractual cash ﬂows collected

¼

The risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed

¼

The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity

The Group’s business model assessment is as follows:

Directors’ report

Financial assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income
Debt instruments held at amortised cost or held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) have contractual terms that give
rise to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI characteristics). Principal is the fair value of the ﬁnancial asset at
initial recognition but this may change over the life of the instrument as amounts are repaid. Interest consists of consideration for the time
value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks
and costs, as well as a proﬁt margin.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

13. Financial instruments continued
Financial assets which have SPPI characteristics and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold ﬁnancial assets to
collect contractual cash ﬂows (‘hold to collect’) are recorded at amortised cost. Conversely, ﬁnancial assets which have SPPI characteristics
but are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets (‘hold
to collect and sell’) are classiﬁed as held at FVOCI.
Both hold to collect business and a hold to collect and sell business model involve holding ﬁnancial assets to collect the contractual cash
ﬂows. However, the business models are distinct by reference to the frequency and signiﬁcance that asset sales play in meeting the objective
under which a particular group of ﬁnancial assets is managed. Hold to collect business models are characterised by asset sales that are
incidental to meeting the objectives under which a group of assets is managed. Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can
be made to manage increases in the credit risk of ﬁnancial assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or insigniﬁcant.
Cash ﬂows from the sale of ﬁnancial assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achieving the objectives
under which a particular group of ﬁnancial assets are managed. This may be the case where frequent sales of ﬁnancial assets are required to
manage the Group’s daily liquidity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liquidity of ﬁnancial instruments. Sales of
assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more signiﬁcant in value than those under the
hold to collect model.
Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI
Non-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at initial recognition
as held at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. Dividends received are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of these instruments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss even on derecognition.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets which are not held at amortised cost or that are not held at fair value through other comprehensive income are held at fair
value through proﬁt or loss. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or loss are either mandatorily classiﬁed fair value
through proﬁt or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss at initial recognition.
Mandatorily classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets and liabilities which are mandatorily held at fair value through proﬁt or loss are split between two subcategories as follows:
Trading, including:
¼

Financial assets and liabilities held for trading, which are those acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term; and

¼

Derivatives

Non-trading mandatorily at fair value through proﬁt or loss, including;
¼

Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model (see the Group’s business model assessment) which are not trading
or derivatives;

¼

Hybrid ﬁnancial assets that contain one or more embedded derivatives;

¼

Financial assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characteristics;

¼

Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI; and

¼

Financial liabilities that constitute contingent consideration in a business combination.

Designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss when the designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces
a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis (‘accounting
mismatch’).
Interest rate swaps have been acquired by the Group with the intention of signiﬁcantly reducing interest rate risk on certain debt securities
with ﬁxed rates of interest. To signiﬁcantly reduce the accounting mismatch between assets and liabilities and measurement bases, these
debt securities have been designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
Similarly, to reduce accounting mismatches, the Group has designated certain ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss where the
liabilities either:
¼

Have ﬁxed rates of interest and interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivatives have been entered with the intention of signiﬁcantly
reducing interest rate risk; or

¼

Are exposed to foreign currency risk and derivatives have been acquired with the intention of signiﬁcantly reducing exposure to market
changes; or

¼

Have been acquired to fund trading asset portfolios or assets

Financial liabilities may also be designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have a
embedded derivative where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivative component.

Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities that are not ﬁnancial guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities held at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities held at amortised cost.

Strategic report

13. Financial instruments continued

Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a
speciﬁc date or at the option of the shareholder, are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds. The dividends
on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective
interest method.

Directors’ report

Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments
The Group issues ﬁnancial guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Under a ﬁnancial guarantee contract, the Group
undertakes to meet a customer’s obligations under the terms of a debt instrument if the customer fails to do so. Loan commitments are ﬁrm
commitments to provide credit under prespeciﬁed terms and conditions. Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments issued at
below market interest rates are initially recognised as liabilities at fair value, while ﬁnancial guarantees and loan commitments issued at market
rates are recorded off-balance sheet. Subsequently, these instruments are measured at the higher of the expected credit loss provision, and
the amount initially recognised less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. Refer to Note 8 (page 255) for expected credit loss on loan commitments and ﬁnancial guarantees.
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous
market to which the Group has access at the date. The fair value of a liability includes the risk that the bank will not be able to honour its
obligations.

The fair values of quoted ﬁnancial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if
transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If the
market for a ﬁnancial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
Initial recognition
Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or loss, and debt securities classiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets
held at fair value through other comprehensive income, are initially recognised on the trade-date (the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell the asset). Loans and advances and other ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date
(the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers).

In certain circumstances, the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of proﬁts or losses at
the time of initial recognition. However, these proﬁts or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on
observable market data. In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs,
the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement but is amortised
or released to the income statement as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.

Where a ﬁnancial instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship, its carrying value is
adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Financial assets held at FVOCI
Debt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate
component of equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income. Changes in expected credit
losses are recognised in the proﬁt or loss and are accumulated in equity. On derecognition, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of
the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the proﬁt or loss.

Supplementary information

Subsequent measurement
Financial assets and fnancial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
(see Interest income and expense). Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs
for ﬁnancial assets which are not subsequently measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss.

Risk review and capital review

The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual ﬁnancial instrument. However, when a group of
ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risk or credit risk, the fair value of the group
of ﬁnancial instruments is measured on a net basis.

Equity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in
fair value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate
component of equity. On derecognition, the cumulative reserve is transferred to retained earnings and is not recycled to proﬁt or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proft or loss
Financial assets and liabilities mandatorily held at fair value through proﬁt or loss and ﬁnancial assets designated at fair value through proﬁt or
loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recorded in the net trading income line in
the proﬁt or loss unless the instrument is part of a cash ﬂow hedging relationship. Contractual interest income on ﬁnancial assets held at fair
value through proﬁt or loss is recognised as interest income in a separate line in the proﬁt or loss.

267

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

13. Financial instruments continued
Financial liabilities designated at fair value through proft or loss
Financial liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss are held at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the net trading
income line in the proﬁt or loss, other than that attributable to changes in credit risk. Fair value changes attributable to credit risk are
recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a separate category of reserves unless this is expected to create or enlarge an
accounting mismatch, in which case the entire change in fair value of the ﬁnancial liability designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss is
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial assets have expired or where the Group has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred
and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.
Where ﬁnancial assets have been modiﬁed, the modiﬁed terms are assessed on a qualitative and quantitative basis to determine whether a
fundamental change in the nature of the instrument has occurred, such as whether the derecognition of the pre-existing instrument and the
recognition of a new instrument is appropriate.
On derecognition of a ﬁnancial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the
portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability
assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in proﬁt or loss except for
equity instruments elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in
other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished. A ﬁnancial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged,
cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, where a ﬁnancial liability has been modiﬁed, it is
derecognised if the difference between the modiﬁed cash ﬂows and the original cash ﬂows is more than 10 per cent.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration
paid is included in ‘Other income’ except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in
other comprehensive income which are never recycled to the proﬁt or loss.
Modiﬁed ﬁnancial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities whose original contractual terms have been modiﬁed, including those loans subject to forbearance
strategies, are considered to be modiﬁed instruments. Modiﬁcations may include changes to the tenor, cash ﬂows and/or interest rates
among other factors.
Where derecognition of ﬁnancial assets is appropriate (see Derecognition), the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine
whether the assets should be classiﬁed as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).
Where derecognition is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the
renegotiated or modiﬁed contractual cash ﬂows discounted at the original effective interest rate (or credit adjusted effective interest rate for
POCI ﬁnancial assets). The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modiﬁed gross carrying values of the instruments are
recorded as a modiﬁcation gain or loss in the proﬁt or loss.
Gains and losses arising from modiﬁcations for credit reasons are recorded as part of ‘Credit impairment’ (see credit Impairment policy).
Modiﬁcation gains and losses arising for non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of ‘Credit impairment’ or within income depending
on whether there has been a change in the credit risk on the ﬁnancial asset subsequent to the modiﬁcation. Modiﬁcation gains and losses
arising on ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised within income. The movements in the applicable expected credit loss loan positions are disclosed
in further detail in Risk review.
Reclassiﬁcations
Financial liabilities are not reclassiﬁed subsequent to initial recognition. Reclassiﬁcations of ﬁnancial assets are made when, and only when,
the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of signiﬁcant external or
internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value
of pre-existing held for trading ﬁnancial assets through a hold to collect model.
Financial assets are reclassiﬁed at their fair value on the date of reclassiﬁcation and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated.
Moreover, reclassiﬁcations of ﬁnancial assets between ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost and ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through
other comprehensive income do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.
Reclassiﬁed from amortised cost
Where ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost are reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss, the difference
between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassiﬁcation and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
For ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassiﬁed to fair value through other comprehensive income, the difference between the
fair value of the assets at the date of reclassiﬁcation and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in other comprehensive
income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassiﬁed ﬁnancial assets are reclassiﬁed from loan
loss provisions to a separate reserve in other comprehensive income at the date of reclassiﬁcation.

Reclassiﬁed from fair value through other comprehensive income
Where ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through
proﬁt or loss, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the proﬁt or loss.
For ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income that are reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the ﬁnancial asset such
that the ﬁnancial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected
credit losses held within other comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassiﬁed assets at the date
of reclassiﬁcation.

Directors’ report

Reclassiﬁed from fair value through proﬁt or loss
Where ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss are reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through other
comprehensive income or ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassiﬁcation is used to determine the
effective interest rate on the ﬁnancial asset going forward. In addition, the date of reclassiﬁcation is used as the date of initial recognition for
the calculation of expected credit losses. Where ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss are reclassiﬁed to ﬁnancial assets
held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassiﬁcation becomes the gross carrying value of the ﬁnancial asset.

Offsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out above.
Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse
repurchase transactions. These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but
only in the event of default or other predetermined events.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a
default. Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges (legally sells) and obtains (legally purchases) respectively,
highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.
The following tables set out the impact of netting on the balance sheet. This comprises derivative transactions settled through an enforceable
netting agreement where we have the intent and ability to settle net and which are offset on the balance sheet.

Loans and advances designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss
The maximum exposure to credit risk for loans and advances to banks and customers and reverse repurchase and other similar secured
lending designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss was $nil million (1 January 2018: $39 million and 31 December 2017: $3,939 million).
The net fair value gain on loans and advances to banks and customers and reverse repurchase and other similar secured lending designated
at fair value through proﬁt or loss was $nil million (1 January 2018: $nil million and 31 December 2017: $23 million). Of this, $nil million (1 January
2018: $nil million and 31 December 2017: $1 million) relates to changes in credit risk. The cumulative fair value loss attributable to changes in
credit risk was $nil million (1 January 2018: $nil million and 31 December 2017: $1 million). Further details of the Group’s valuation technique is

The net fair value gain on ﬁnancial liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss was $30 million for the year (31 December 2017: net loss

Valuation of ﬁnancial instruments
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date in the principal market or, in the absence of this, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that
date. The fair value of a liability reﬂects the Group’s non-performance risk. The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments is generally measured on the
basis of the individual ﬁnancial instrument. However, when a group of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net
exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the fair value of the group of ﬁnancial instruments is measured on a net basis.
The fair values of quoted ﬁnancial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if
transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by
the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using
valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash ﬂow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments
that have characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.

274

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Valuation of ﬁnancial instruments continued
The Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price veriﬁcation, oversight of fair value and prudent value adjustments and
escalation of valuation issues. Independent price veriﬁcation is the process of determining that the valuations incorporated into the ﬁnancial
statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product. The Valuation Control function has oversight of the fair
value adjustments to ensure the ﬁnancial instruments are priced to exit. These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations
incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements. The market data used for price veriﬁcation may include data sourced from recent trade data involving
external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers. Valuation Control performs a
semi-annual review of the suitability of the market data used for price testing. Price veriﬁcation uses independently sourced data that is deemed
most representative of the market the instruments trade in. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence,
relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.

Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
The Group evaluates the signiﬁcance of ﬁnancial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements
as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at
the balance sheet date.
Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments are determined using valuation techniques and estimates (see below) which, to the extent possible, use
market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Changes in the observability of signiﬁcant valuation
inputs can materially affect the fair values of ﬁnancial instruments

¼

When establishing the exit price of a ﬁnancial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in
determining the fair value (page 276)

¼

In determining the valuation of ﬁnancial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and
valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the signiﬁcant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments
(page 277)

¼

Where the estimate measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that
use a signiﬁcant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs

Directors’ report

The Valuation and Benchmarks Committee (VBC) is the valuation governance forum consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk,
Product Control, Valuation Control and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory.
For Principal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.

Strategic report

13. Financial instruments continued

Financial instruments held at fair value

–

Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group. Where independent market data is
available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classiﬁed as Level 2. Where such liquid external prices are not
available, valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are
classiﬁed as Level 3. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxies from comparable
issuers or assets

–

Derivatives: Derivative products are classiﬁed as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are
observable from independent and reliable market data sources. Derivative products are classiﬁed as Level 3 if there are signiﬁcant valuation
input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying
variable. Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and
interest rate products with quanto payouts. In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be implied from the market,
and methods such as historical analysis and comparison with historical levels or other benchmark data must be employed

–

Equity shares – private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples – Price-toEarnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/EBITDA) ratios – of comparable listed
companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and
earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. To ensure comparability between these unquoted investments and the comparable
listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied (for example, liquidity and size) in the valuation. In circumstances where an
investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable
external sources, alternative valuation techniques (for example, discounted cash ﬂow models), which use predominantly unobservable
inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from
third-party sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those
where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter (OTC) prices) are classiﬁed as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation
methods involve judgements ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash ﬂow method
is applied

Supplementary information

Debt securities – asset-backed securities: Asset-backed securities are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus
pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers’ quotes, etc. Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is
classiﬁed as Level 2. In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classiﬁed as Level 3. The fair value of
Level 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash ﬂow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment
speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.
Therefore, once external pricing has been veriﬁed, an assessment is made of whether each security is traded with signiﬁcant liquidity
based on its credit rating and sector. If a security is of high credit rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classiﬁed as Level 2,
otherwise it will be classiﬁed as Level 3

Valuation techniques continued
– Loans and advances: These primarily include loans in the global syndications business which were not syndicated as of the balance
sheet date and other ﬁnancing transactions within Financial Markets and loans and advances including reverse repurchase agreements
that do not have SPPI cash ﬂows or are managed on a fair value basis. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available,
their valuation is based on market observable credit spreads. If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on
comparable loans with similar credit grade, sector and region, are used. Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy
methods are available, these loans are classiﬁed as Level 2. Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans
are classiﬁed as Level 3
–

¼

Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted
prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classiﬁed as Level 2 and
valued using such quotes. Where there are signiﬁcant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the
complexity of the product, these are classiﬁed as Level 3. The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such
as bond spreads and credit spreads. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxied from
comparable issuers or assets

Financial instruments held at amortised cost

The following sets out the Group’s basis for establishing fair values of amortised cost ﬁnancial instruments and their classiﬁcation between
Levels 1, 2 and 3. As certain categories of ﬁnancial instruments are not actively traded, there is a signiﬁcant level of management judgement
involved in calculating the fair values:
–

Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts

–

Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on
quoted market prices. For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash ﬂow model is used based on a
current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity

–

Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. The
estimated fair value of ﬁxed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash
ﬂows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity

–

Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of
valuation techniques to determine fair value. Where available, securities are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related
underlying (for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer) or input proxies from a different underlying (for example,
a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating). Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in
such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs. This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and
predominantly relates to asset-backed securities. The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the
underlying cash ﬂows

–

Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of ﬂoating rate placements and
overnight deposits is their carrying amount. The estimated fair value of ﬁxed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash ﬂows
using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity. The Group’s loans and advances to
customers’ portfolio is well diversiﬁed by geography and industry. Approximately a quarter of the portfolio reprices within one month, and
approximately half re-prices within 12 months. Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment. The fair value of loans
and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair
value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash ﬂows
expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and credit risk. Expected cash ﬂows are discounted at current
market rates to determine fair value. The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a
result providing quantiﬁcation of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical

–

Other assets: Other assets comprise primarily of cash collateral and trades pending settlement. The carrying amount of these ﬁnancial
instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value as they are either short-term in nature or reprice to current market
rates frequently

Fair value adjustments
When establishing the exit price of a ﬁnancial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price
which market participants would make when pricing that instrument. The main valuation adjustments (described further below) in determining
fair value for ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are as follows:

Fair value adjustments continued
¼ Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Where market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, a bid-offer
valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business’ positions through dealing away in the market,
thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative
portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where
long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems

Day one proﬁt and loss: In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the
recognition of proﬁts or losses at the time of initial recognition. However, these proﬁts or losses can only be recognised when the valuation
technique used is based primarily on observable market data. In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation
model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not
recognised immediately in the income statement. The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable,
or the transaction matures or is terminated

¼

Debit valuation adjustment (DVA): The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivative liabilities to reﬂect changes in its own credit
standing. The Group’s DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
For derivative liabilities, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Group’s probability of default to the Group’s negative expected
exposure against the counterparty. The Group’s probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond
spreads associated with the Group’s issuances and market standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on the
simulation of the underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty. This simulation methodology
incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements

¼

Funding valuation adjustment (FVA): The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products. FVA reﬂects an estimate of the
adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs that could arise in relation to the exposure.
FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures
that reﬂect the market cost of funding. The FVA for collateralised derivatives is based on discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at
the relevant overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate after taking into consideration the terms of the underlying collateral agreement with the
counterparty. The FVA for uncollateralised (including partially collateralised) derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the
market funding cost or beneﬁt associated with funding these transactions

¼

Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing deﬁciencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment.
These pricing deﬁciencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model

In addition, the Group calculates own credit adjustment (OCA) on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes, in order to
reﬂect changes in its own credit standing. The Group’s OCA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if
its credit standing improves. The Group’s OCA adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature. For issued debt and structured notes
designated at fair value, an OCA adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash ﬂows using a yield curve adjusted for market
observed secondary senior unsecured credit spreads. The OCA at 31 December 2018 is $476 million, other comprehensive income gain
$394 million (31 December 2017: $82 million, other comprehensive income loss $249 million).

¼

Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

¼

Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in inactive markets and ﬁnancial instruments valued using models where all signiﬁcant inputs are observable

¼

Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where at least one input which could have a signiﬁcant effect on the instrument’s valuation is
not based on observable market data

Supplementary information

Fair value hierarchy – ﬁnancial instruments held at fair value
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classiﬁed into three levels according to the observability
of the signiﬁcant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observability of signiﬁcant valuation inputs during the reporting period
may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value
hierarchy when there is a signiﬁcant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques
as at the end of the reporting period.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

¼

Risk review and capital review

Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): The Group makes CVA adjustment against the fair value of derivative products. CVA is an adjustment
to the fair value of the transactions to reﬂect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of
the outstanding transactions. It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price
to acquire our exposures. CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure
and takes account of any collateral we may hold. The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future positive exposure, marketimplied probability of default (PD) and recovery rates. Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies
to estimate the PD. Wrong-way risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that
counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for certain key wrong-way exposures. The Group also
captures the uncertainties associated with wrong-way risk in its Prudential Valuation Adjustments

13. Financial instruments continued
Level 3 summary and signiﬁcant unobservable inputs continued
The following section describes the signiﬁcant unobservable inputs identiﬁed in the valuation technique table:

284

¼

Commodities correlation: This refers to the correlation between two commodity underlyings over a speciﬁed time

¼

Comparable price/yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where
there are no direct observable prices. Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash ﬂows in a discounted cash ﬂow model.
Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a
comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the instrument. The adjustment should account for relevant
differences in the ﬁnancial instruments such as maturity and/or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between
the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument (for example, deriving a fair value
for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond). An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement
in the fair value of the asset. An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset

¼

Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable inﬂuences the movement in another variable. An equity correlation is the
correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates

¼

Credit spread represents the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument

¼

Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash ﬂows into present value

¼

EV/EBITDA ratio multiples: This is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation
(EBITDA). EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents. An increase in EV/EBITDA multiples in
isolation, will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm

¼

Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time

¼

Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments: A liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted ﬁrms’
investments to reﬂect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase in liquidity discount will result in unfavourable movement
in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm

¼

Price-Book (P/B) multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity. An increase in P/B multiple will result in
a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm

¼

Price-Earnings (P/E) multiples: This is the ratio of the market capitalisation to the net income after tax. The multiples are determined from
multiples of listed comparables, which are observable. An increase in P/E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the
unlisted ﬁrm

¼

Price-Sales (P/S) multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales. An increase in P/S multiple will result in a favourable
movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm

¼

Recovery rates are the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan. As the probability of default
increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reﬂect its expected recovery level assuming default.
An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan

¼

Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Generally, the higher
the volatility, the more expensive the option will be

Sensitivities in respect of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities
Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs. The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on
the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The percentage shift is determined
by statistical analyses performed on a set of reference prices based on the composition of our Level 3 assets. Favourable and unfavourable
changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters.
This Level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.

14. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Accounting policy
Accounting for derivatives: Derivatives are ﬁnancial instruments that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, ﬁnancial
instrument prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices. Derivatives are categorised as trading unless they are
designated as hedging instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in proﬁt or loss (except where
cash ﬂow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised within other
comprehensive income).

Directors’ report

Fair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including
discounted cash ﬂow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. Where the initially recognised fair value of a derivative contract is
based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same initial recognition accounting policy
as for other ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value
is negative.
The tables below analyse the notional principal amounts and the positive and negative fair values of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
Notional principal amounts are the amounts of principal underlying the contract at the reporting date.

The Group limits exposure to credit losses in the event of default by entering into master netting agreements with certain market counterparties.
As required by IAS 32, exposures are only presented net in these accounts where they are subject to legal right of offset and intended to be
settled net in the ordinary course of business.

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

14. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments continued
Derivatives held for hedging
Hedge accounting: The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as
a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
a) Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or ﬁrm commitments (fair value hedge)
b) Hedges of highly probable future cash ﬂows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction (cash ﬂow hedge)
c) Hedges of the net investment of a foreign operation (net investment hedges)
Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way, provided certain criteria are met.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash ﬂows of hedged items. Expected effectiveness should be close to 100 per cent and actual results of the hedge using
regression analysis, are expected to be within a range of 80-125 per cent.
The Group may enter into economic hedges that do not qualify for IAS 39 hedge accounting treatment. Where these economic hedges use
derivatives to offset risk, the derivatives are fair valued, with fair value changes recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Fair value hedge: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the
income statement, within trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the
hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which
the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity or derecognition.
The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate and currency risk is discussed in Market risk (page 181).

Fair value hedges
The Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange ﬁxed rates for ﬂoating rates on funding to match ﬂoating rates received on assets, or exchange
ﬁxed rates on assets to match ﬂoating rates paid on funding. These include ﬁxed rate issued notes, loans and advances to customer and debt
securities and other eligible bills.

Strategic report

14. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments continued

For qualifying hedges, the fair value changes of the derivative are substantially matched by corresponding fair value changes of the hedged item,
both of which are recognised in proﬁt or loss. All qualifying hedges were effective. Included in net losses and net gains below is an adjustment in
respect of hedge ineffectiveness. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness is due to basis risk on hedged currencies.
At 31 December 2018 the Group held the following interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest risk.

Cash ﬂow hedges
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the variability in future cash ﬂows on assets and liabilities that have ﬂoating rates of interest by
exchanging the ﬂoating rates for ﬁxed rates. It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variability in future
exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the variability on the cash ﬂow affects proﬁt or loss,
at which time the gains or losses are transferred to proﬁt or loss.

Net investment hedges
A foreign currency exposure arises from a net investment in subsidiaries that have a different functional currency from that of the Group. This risk
arises from the ﬂuctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Group’s functional currency, which
causes the amount of the investment to vary.
The Group uses a combination of foreign exchange contracts and non-derivative ﬁnancial assets to manage the variability in future exchange
rates on its net investments in foreign currencies. Gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the
net investment is disposed of.

16. Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar secured lending
and borrowing
Accounting policy
The Group purchases securities (a reverse repurchase agreement – ‘reverse repo’) typically with ﬁnancial institutions subject to a
commitment to resell or return the securities at a predetermined price. These securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group
does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, however they are recorded off-balance sheet as collateral received. Consideration paid
(or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is managed on a fair value basis or designated at fair
value through proﬁt or loss.
The Group also sells securities (a repurchase agreement – ‘repo’) subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a
predetermined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership and these securities are disclosed as pledged collateral. Consideration received (or cash collateral received) is accounted for
as a ﬁnancial liability at amortised cost, unless it is either mandatorily classiﬁed as fair value through proﬁt or loss or irrevocably designated
at fair value through proﬁt or loss at initial recognition.
Financial assets are pledged as collateral as part of sales and repurchases, securities borrowing and securitisation transactions under terms
that are usual and customary for such activities. The Group is obliged to return equivalent securities.
Repo and reverse repo transactions typically entitle the Group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets similar to those provided
as collateral in the event of a default. Securities sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or
through a securities sale and Total Return Swap (TRS) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially
the associated risks and rewards of the securities (the TRS is not recognised). The counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or
customer accounts, as appropriate. Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge
these to obtain funding.

17. Goodwill and intangible assets

Directors’ report

Accounting policy
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets and
contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in Intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in Investments in associates. Goodwill included in intangible
assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Gains and
losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Detailed calculations are performed
based on discounting expected cash ﬂows of the relevant cash generating units (CGUs) and discounting these at an appropriate discount
rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generate separate cash inﬂows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. These are equal to or smaller than the Group’s reportable segments (as set out in Note 2) as the Group views its
reportable segments on a global basis. The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table (page 298).
Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
The carrying amount of goodwill is based on the application of judgements including the basis of goodwill impairment calculation
assumptions. Judgement is also applied in determination of cash generating units.
Estimates include forecasts used for determining cash ﬂows for CGUs and discount rates which factor in country risk free rates and
applicable risk premiums. The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill on-balance sheet
is impaired. The estimation of future cash ﬂows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires signiﬁcant
judgement and subject to potential change over time.

Risk review and capital review

Acquired intangibles
At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other
legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identiﬁable assets acquired. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value,
which reﬂects market expectations of the probability that the future economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset will ﬂow to the entity, and are
amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives (4 to 16 years). At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of
impairment. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down
immediately.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁc software.
Direct costs of the development of separately identiﬁable internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future
economic beneﬁts attributable to the asset will ﬂow from its use (internally generated software). These costs include salaries and wages,
materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software
are expensed immediately when incurred. Internally generated software is amortised over a three to ﬁve year time period.

17. Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Goodwill
CGU structure
When considering the generation of independent cash inﬂows and appropriate level of management, Corporate Finance, Private Banking and
Transaction Banking are managed on a global basis, while Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Central and others including Treasury Market
activities are managed on a country basis.
Testing of goodwill for impairment
An annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill
is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its
recoverable amount. Indicators of impairment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region including geopolitical
changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decisions to exit certain regions. The recoverable
amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value-in-use (ViU). The calculation of ViU for each CGU is calculated using ﬁve-year cash
ﬂow projections and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year ﬁve. The cash ﬂow projections are based on forecasts
approved by management up to 2023. The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year ﬁve cash ﬂows using long-term GDP
growth rates. All cash ﬂows are discounted using discount rates which reﬂect market rates appropriate to the CGU.
The goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely
estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill.

The Group has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions for each CGU’s recoverable amount. None of the CGUs are sensitive to
reasonable adverse changes in key assumptions (10 per cent fall in cash ﬂow, 1 per cent increase in the discount rate or 1 per cent fall in GDP
rates). The following CGUs are considered sensitive to the key variables and any movements up to the levels disclosed below would eliminate
the current headroom.

At each balance sheet date the assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, including assessing for
indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is
written down to the recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are included in the income statement.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial period in which they are incurred.

Risk review and capital review

Accounting policy
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Land and buildings comprise mainly branches and ofﬁces. Freehold land is not depreciated although it is subject to impairment testing.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated
useful lives, as follows:
Buildings

up to 50 years

¼

Leasehold improvements life of lease

up to 50 years

¼

Equipment and motor vehicles

three to 15 years

¼

Aircraft

up to 18 years

¼

Ships

up to 15 years

Where the Group is a lessee under ﬁnance leases, the leased assets are capitalised and included in Property, plant and equipment with a
corresponding liability to the lessor recognised in Other liabilities. Finance charges payable are recognised over the period of the lease based
on the interest rate implicit in the lease to give a constant periodic rate of return.

19. Operating lease commitments
Accounting policy
The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and
rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor. The Group leases various premises under non-cancellable lease arrangements.
The total payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty
is recognised as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.
If an operating lease contains a reinstatement clause, a provision will be raised for the best estimate of the expenses to be incurred at the end
of the lease to reinstate the property to its original condition. This cost is amortised over the life of the lease.

24. Provisions for liabilities and charges
Accounting policy
The Group recognises a provision for a present legal or constructive obligation resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that
it will be required to transfer economic beneﬁts to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Where a
liability arises based on participation in a market at a speciﬁed date, the obligation is recognised in the ﬁnancial statements on that date and
is not accrued over the period.
Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
The recognition and measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges requires signiﬁcant judgement and the use of estimates about
uncertain future conditions or events.
Estimates include the best estimate of the probability of outﬂow of economic resources, cost of settling a provision and timing of settlement.
Judgements are required for inherently uncertain areas such as legal decisions (including external advice obtained), and outcome of
regulator reviews.

Provision for credit commitment comprises those undrawn contractually committed facilities where there is doubt as to the borrowers’ ability to
meet their repayment obligations.
Other provisions consists mainly of provisions for regulatory settlements and legal claims (including provisions for potential penalties relating
to the US investigation, the FCA decision and the previously disclosed foreign exchange trading issues), the nature of which are described in
Note 26 (page 305).

25. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by uncertain future events or
present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because either an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts is not probable or the
amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but information about them is disclosed
unless the possibility of any outﬂow of economic beneﬁts in settlement is remote.
Where the Group undertakes to make a payment on behalf of its customers for guarantees issued such as for performance bonds or as
irrevocable letters of credit as part of the Group’s Transaction Banking business, for which an obligation to make a payment has not arisen
at the reporting date, those are included in these ﬁnancial statements as contingent liabilities.
Other contingent liabilities primarily include revocable letters of credit and bonds issued on behalf of customers to customs ofﬁcials, for bids
or offers and as shipping guarantees.
Commitments are where the Group has conﬁrmed its intention to provide funds to a customer or on behalf of a customer in the form of
loans, overdrafts, future guarantees whether cancellable or not or letters of credit and the Group has not made payments at the balance
sheet date; those instruments are included in these ﬁnancial statement as commitments.
Capital commitments are contractual commitments the Group has entered into to purchase non-ﬁnancial assets.

made to date in respect of these aircraft

The Group’s share of contingent liabilities and commitments relating to joint ventures is $0.2 billion (31 December 2017: $0.2 billion). As set out
in Note 26, the Group has contingent liabilities in respect of certain legal and regulatory matters for which it is not practicable to estimate the
ﬁnancial impact as there are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes.

26. Legal and regulatory matters

Claims and other proceedings
The Group receives legal claims against it in a number of jurisdictions and is subject to regulatory investigations and proceedings arising in the
normal course of business.
Apart from the matters described below, the Group currently considers none of these claims, investigations or proceedings to be material.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters
currently not considered to be material may not ultimately be material to the Group’s results in a particular reporting period depending on,
among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the results otherwise reported for such period.

Supplementary information

2012 Settlements with certain US authorities
In 2012, the Group reached settlements with certain US authorities regarding US sanctions compliance in the period 2001 to 2007, involving a
Consent Order by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a Cease and Desist Order by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Fed), Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) with each of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New York County
District Attorney’s Ofﬁce (DANY) and a Settlement Agreement with the Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control (together, the ‘Settlements’ and together
the foregoing authorities, the ‘US authorities’). In addition to the civil penalties totalling $667 million, the terms of these Settlements include a
number of conditions and ongoing obligations with regard to improving sanctions, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
controls such as remediation programmes, reporting requirements, compliance reviews and programmes, banking transparency requirements,
training measures, audit programmes, disclosure obligations and, in connection with the NYDFS Consent Order, the appointment of an
independent monitor (Monitor).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounting policy
Where appropriate, the Group recognises a provision for liabilities when it is probable that an outﬂow of economic resources embodying
economic beneﬁts will be required and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The uncertainties inherent in legal and
regulatory matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outﬂows with respect to which provisions have been established.

Risk review and capital review

Contracted capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in these accounts1

In December 2014, the Group announced that the DOJ, DANY and the Group had agreed to a three-year extension of the DPAs, resulting in
the subsequent retention of the Monitor to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the Group’s sanctions compliance programme.
The DPAs (and the term of the independent monitor) have been subject to subsequent extensions and currently expire on 31 March 2019.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

26. Legal and regulatory matters continued
Claims and other proceedings continued
2014 Settlement with NYDFS
In August 2014, the Group announced that it had reached a ﬁnal settlement with the NYDFS regarding deﬁciencies in the AML transaction
surveillance system in its New York branch (the ‘Branch’). The system, which is separate from the sanctions screening process, is one part of
the Group’s overall ﬁnancial crime controls and is designed to alert the Branch to unusual transaction patterns that require further investigation
on a post-transaction basis.
The settlement provisions included a civil monetary penalty of $300 million; various remediation requirements and the appointment of the
Monitor which eventually expired on 31 December 2018.
In November 2018, the Group announced it had agreed to engage an independent consultant selected by the NYDFS for up to one year
with a possible extension for up to one additional year to provide guidance in connection with tasks necessary to complete the remediation
contemplated by the 2012 and 2014 Consent Orders.
2019 Settlement relating to FX trading
In January 2019, the Group reached a settlement with the NYDFS regarding past control failures and improper conduct related to the
Group’s FX trading and sales business between 2007 and 2013. As part of this settlement the Group agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty
of $40 million to the NYDFS. A provision has been made in these ﬁnancial statements for the previously disclosed investigations relating to
the FX trading issues including the January 2019 settlement with the NYDFS.
Investigations into legacy fnancial crime control issues
The Group has received a decision notice from the Regulatory Decisions Committee of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) relating to the
previously disclosed investigation by the FCA concerning the Group’s historical ﬁnancial crime control issues, and is considering its options in
relation to this decision notice, including the possibility of an appeal. The decision notice imposes a penalty of £102 million (net of early settlement
discount) on the Group. This investigation had been focused on the effectiveness and governance of those historical ﬁnancial crime controls
from 2009 through 2014 within the correspondent banking business carried out by the Group’s London branch, particularly in relation to the
business carried on with respondent banks from outside the European Economic Area, and the effectiveness and governance of those controls
in one of the Group’s overseas branches and the oversight exercised at Group level over those controls.
The Group continues its discussions relating to the potential resolution of an investigation by the US authorities relating to historical violations of
US sanctions laws and regulations. In contrast to the 2012 settlements, which focused on the period before the Group’s 2007 decision to stop
doing new business with known Iranian parties, this investigation is focused on examining the extent to which conduct and control failures
permitted clients with Iranian interests to conduct transactions through Standard Chartered Bank after 2007. The vast majority of the issues
under investigation pre-date 2012 and none occurred after 2014.
The resolution of the US investigation may involve a range of civil and criminal penalties including substantial monetary penalties combined with
other compliance measures such as remediation requirements and/or business restrictions.
A provision has been made in these ﬁnancial statements for the penalty in the FCA decision notice and potential penalties relating to the
investigation by the US authorities. This provision reﬂects management’s current view of the appropriate level of provision. Resolution of the
US investigation and the FCA process might ultimately result in a different level of penalties.
Other proceedings
Since November 2014, seven lawsuits have been ﬁled in the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York
against a number of banks (including Standard Chartered Bank) on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are relatives of, victims of various terrorist
attacks in Iraq. Five of the lawsuits were ﬁled in late December 2018. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant banks aided and abetted the
unlawful conduct of US sanctioned parties in breach of the US Anti-Terrorism Act. The lawsuits are at an early procedural stage, with motions
to dismiss pending in two of the seven lawsuits. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible for the Group to predict the outcome of
these lawsuits.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and related agencies in Kenya are investigating Standard Chartered Kenya Limited (SCBK) and
other banks in connection with the alleged theft of funds from Kenya’s State Department of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs. This
investigation follows ﬁnes being imposed on those banks, including SCBK, by the Central Bank of Kenya regarding adequacy of controls related
to the processing of the allegedly stolen funds. The DPP has announced that it has received recommendations from the Kenyan Directorate
of Criminal Investigations that charges should be brought against a number of banks, including SCBK, bank ofﬁcials and other individuals.
The Group does not know whether any charges will be brought, but there may be penalties or other ﬁnancial consequences for SCBK in
connection with this investigation.

28. Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves
Accounting policy
Financial instruments issued are classiﬁed as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash, other ﬁnancial assets or issue
available number of own equity instruments. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no ﬁxed maturity or redemption date are classiﬁed as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
Where the Company or other members of the consolidated Group purchase the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid is
deducted from the total shareholders’ equity of the Group and/or of the Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where such
shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity of the Group and/or the Company.

28. Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued

On 17 May 2018, the Company issued 1,354,700 new ordinary shares instead of the 2017 ﬁnal dividend. On 22 October 2018, the Company
issued 876,126 new ordinary shares instead of the 2018 interim dividend.
During the period 10,008,515 shares were issued under employee share plans at prices between nil and 620 pence.

The available proﬁts of the Company are distributed to the holders of the issued preference shares in priority to payments made to holders of
the ordinary shares and in priority to, or pari passu with, any payments to the holders of any other class of shares in issue. On a winding up, the
assets of the Company are applied to the holders of the preference shares in priority to any payment to the ordinary shareholders and in priority
to, or pari passu with, the holders of any other shares in issue, for an amount equal to any dividends accrued and/or payable and the nominal
value of the shares together with any premium as determined by the Board. The redeemable preference shares are redeemable at the paid up
amount (which includes premium) at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms of the shares. The holders of the preference
shares are not entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting except where any relevant dividend due is not paid in full or where a resolution
is proposed varying the rights of the preference shares.

The principal terms of the AT1 securities are described below:

¼

The securities are also redeemable for certain regulatory or tax reasons on any date at 100 per cent of their principal amount together with
any accrued but unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the date ﬁxed for redemption. Any redemption is subject to Standard Chartered PLC
giving notice to the relevant regulator and the regulator granting permission to redeem

¼

The interest rate in respect of the securities issued on 2 April 2015 for the period from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding) 2 April
2020 is a ﬁxed rate of 6.50 per cent per annum. The ﬁrst reset date for the interest rate is 2 April 2020 and each date falling ﬁve, or an integral
multiple of ﬁve years after the ﬁrst reset date

¼

The interest rate in respect of the securities issued on 18 August 2016 for the period from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding)
2 April 2022 is a ﬁxed rate of 7.50 per cent per annum. The ﬁrst reset date for the interest rate is 2 April 2022 and each date falling ﬁve years,
or an integral multiple of ﬁve years, after the ﬁrst reset date

¼

The interest rate in respect of the securities issued on 18 January 2017 for the period from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding)
2 April 2023 is a ﬁxed rate of 7.75 per cent per annum. The ﬁrst reset date for the interest rate is 2 April 2023 and each date falling ﬁve years,
or an integral multiple of ﬁve years, after the ﬁrst reset date

¼

The interest on each of the securities will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 2 April and 2 October in each year, accounted for as
a dividend

¼

Interest on the securities is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of Standard Chartered PLC, subject to certain additional
restrictions set out in the terms and conditions. Accordingly, Standard Chartered PLC may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment
(or part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date

¼

The securities convert into ordinary shares of Standard Chartered PLC, at a pre-determined price, should the fully loaded Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio of the Group fall below 7.0 per cent. Approximately 572 million ordinary shares would be required to satisfy the conversion of all
the securities mentioned above

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

28. Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued
Reserves
The constituents of the reserves are summarised as follows:
¼

The capital reserve represents the exchange difference on redenomination of share capital and share premium from sterling to US dollars in
2001. The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of preference shares redeemed

¼

Merger reserve represents the premium arising on shares issued using a cash box ﬁnancing structure, which required the Company to create
a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the
funding of certain acquisitions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, and for the shares issued in 2009 in
the placing. The funding raised by the 2008 and 2010 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained within the Company

¼

Own credit adjustment reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on ﬁnancial liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁt or
loss relating to own credit. Following the Group’s decision to early apply this IFRS 9 requirement the cumulative OCA component of ﬁnancial
liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss has been transferred from opening retained earnings to the OCA reserve. Gains and
losses on ﬁnancial liabilities designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss relating to own credit in the year have been taken through other
comprehensive income into this reserve. On derecognition of applicable instruments the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the
income statement, but will be transferred within equity to retained earnings

¼

Fair value through OCI debt reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as fair value
through OCI, net of expected credit losses and taxation. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassiﬁed to the income
statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impaired. Fair value through OCI equity reserve represents unrealised fair
value gains and losses in respect of ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as fair value through OCI, net of taxation. Gains and losses are recorded in this
reserve and never recycled to the income statement

¼

Cash ﬂow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivatives that meet the criteria for these types of
hedges. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassiﬁed to the income statement when the underlying hedged item affects
proﬁt and loss or when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur

¼

Translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the Group in foreign
operations. Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassiﬁed to the income statement when the
underlying foreign operation is disposed. Gains and losses arising from derivatives used as hedges of net investments are netted against
the foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the foreign operations

¼

Retained earnings represents proﬁts and other comprehensive income earned by the Group and Company in the current and prior periods,
together with the after tax increase relating to equity-settled share options, less dividend distributions and own shares held (treasury shares)

A substantial part of the Group’s reserves are held in overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches, principally to support local operations or
to comply with local regulations. The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can
be remitted. In addition, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liabilities might arise.
As at 31 December 2018, the distributable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) were $15.1 billion (31 December 2017:
$15.1 billion). These comprised retained earnings and $12.5 billion of the merger reserve account. Distribution of reserves is subject to
maintaining minimum capital requirements.

30. Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Accounting policy
The Group operates pension and other post-retirement beneﬁt plans around the world, which can be categorised into deﬁned contribution
plans and deﬁned beneﬁt plans.

Risk review and capital review

At 31 December 2018

Directors’ report

Other increases1

For deﬁned contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a statutory or contractual
basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid.

The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method. The present value of the
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows using an interest rate equal to the yield on
high-quality corporate bonds of the same currency and term as the beneﬁt payments.

Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
There are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement beneﬁt obligations of the UK Fund and Overseas Plans. This
measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, inﬂation, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies
which are inherently uncertain; the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.

Supplementary information

Actuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders’ equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income
in the period they arise. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability for the year by applying the
discount rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability, taking
into account any changes in the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability during the year as a result of contributions and beneﬁt payments. Net interest
expense, the cost of the accrual of new beneﬁts, beneﬁt enhancements (or reductions) and administration expenses met directly from plan
assets are recognised in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For funded deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the
balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. For unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt plans the liability recognised at the balance sheet date
is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation.

The Group operates over 50 deﬁned beneﬁt plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now join deﬁned
contribution arrangements. The aim of all these plans is to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is
consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions. The deﬁned beneﬁt plans expose the Group to currency risk,
interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.
The material holdings of government and corporate bonds (page 314) partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate
changes. Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency ﬂuctuation, the increases in discount rates in most geographies over
2018 have led to lower liabilities. These have been somewhat offset by falls in the value of bonds held and poor stock market performance.
These movements are shown as actuarial gains versus losses respectively in the tables below. Contributions into a number of plans in excess
of the amounts required to fund beneﬁts accruing have also helped to reduce the net deﬁcit over the year.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualiﬁed actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial
valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2018.
UK Fund
The Standard Chartered Pension Fund (the ‘UK Fund’) is the Group’s largest pension plan, representing 58 per cent (31 December 2017:
60 per cent) of total pension liabilities, and provides pensions based on 1/60th of ﬁnal salary per year of service, normally payable from age 60.
The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank (its formal sponsor) and, as required by UK legislation, at least one
third of the trustee directors are nominated by members; the remainder are appointed by the Bank. The trustee directors have a ﬁduciary duty
to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.
The ﬁnancial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualiﬁed actuary. The funding valuation as at 31 December 2017
was completed in December 2018 by the Scheme Actuary, A Zegleman of Willis Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those
disclosed (on page 313), and agreed with the UK Fund trustee. It revealed a past service deﬁcit of $203 million (£159 million). To repair the deﬁcit,
four annual cash payments of $42.0 million (£32.9 million) were agreed, with the ﬁrst of these paid in December 2018. The agreement allows
that if the funding position improves to being at or near a surplus in future years the three payments from December 2019 will be reduced or
eliminated. In addition, an escrow account of $140 million (£110 million) exists to provide security for future contributions.
With effect from 1 July 1998, the UK Fund was closed to new entrants and new employees are offered membership of a deﬁned contribution
plan. With effect from 1 April 2018 the UK Fund was closed to further accrual of beneﬁts for the 91 active members remaining at that time.
There is no accounting impact as a result of the closure as the liabilities represented by the beneﬁts already accrued are not expected to be
signiﬁcantly altered by the closure.
As at 31 December 2018, the weighted average duration of the UK Fund was 14 years (31 December 2017: 15 years).
A judgement in respect of Lloyds Bank on 26 October 2018 addressed the requirement to equalise the impact of Guaranteed Minimum
Pensions (GMP) for males and females. The impact on the UK Fund of this judgement was estimated by the Scheme Actuary to be $2 million.
This impact has been recognised as a past service cost in the income statement.
The Group is not required to recognise any additional liability under IFRIC 14 or the 2015 exposure draft of proposed amendments to it, as the
Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.

1 The range of assumptions shown is for the main deﬁned beneﬁt overseas plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, UAE and the US. These comprise over
90 per cent of the total liabilities of overseas deﬁned beneﬁt plans

The principal non-ﬁnancial assumptions are those made for UK life expectancy. The assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that
a male member currently aged 60 will live for 28 years (31 December 2017: 28 years) and a female member for 29 years (31 December 2017:
29 years) and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 30 years (31 December 2017: 30 years) and a female member for 30 years
(31 December 2017: 30 years) after their 60th birthdays.

If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $55 million for the UK Fund (31 December 2017:
$65 million) and $30 million for the other plans (31 December 2017: $30 million)

¼

If the rate of inﬂation increased by 25 basis points the liability, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases would
increase by approximately $40 million for the UK Fund (31 December 2017: $45 million) and $20 million for the other plans (31 December
2017: $20 million)

¼

If the rate salaries increase compared to inﬂation increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by nil for the UK Fund (31 December
2017: $2 million) and approximately $15 million for the other plans (31 December 2017: $15 million)

¼

If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $45 million for the UK Fund (31 December 2017:
$55 million) and $15 million for the other plans (31 December 2017: $15 million)

Although this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash ﬂows expected under the UK Fund, it does provide an approximation
of the sensitivity to the main assumptions. While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as
signiﬁcant.

Both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial assumptions can be expected to change in the future, which would affect the value placed on the liabilities.
For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have

Interest income on pension plan assets

1 The gain In the UK Fund is due to the lower 2017 discretionary pension increase awarded. Costs arising in funded overseas schemes arise primarily in India from the expected
statutory increase in the gratuity payment celling, an early retirement severance plan and a discretionary increase to minimum pensions. The gain in the post-retirement medical plan
arises due to the reduction in eligibility criteria in the US plan

3 The actual return on the UK Fund assets was a loss of $73 million and on overseas plan assets was a gain of $106 million

31. Share-based payments
Accounting policy
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance
award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date. For example, the expense
for awards granted in 2018 in respect of 2017 performance, which vest in 2019-2021, is recognised as an expense over the period from
1 January 2017 to the vesting dates in 2019-2021. For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to
the vesting date.
For equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, proﬁtability and growth targets). The fair
value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value
of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binomial option pricing model. Non-market vesting
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of
the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy a non-market vesting condition are treated as a cancellation
and the remaining unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation. The proceeds received net of any
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
Cash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liability recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any
changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised. Where forfeitures occur prior
to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy market-based performance conditions, the cumulative charge incurred
up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement. Any revaluation related to cash-settled awards is recorded as an amount due
from subsidiary undertakings.
The Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees. Details of the share-based payment
charge are set out below.

2011 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the ‘2011 Plan’)
The 2011 Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2011 and is the Group’s main share plan. Since approval, it has been used to deliver
various types of share awards:
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures. Performance measures attached to awards
granted previously include: total shareholder return (TSR); return on equity (RoE) with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) underpin; strategic
measures; earnings per share (EPS) growth; and return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA). Each measure is assessed independently over
a three-year period. Awards granted from 2016 have an individual conduct gateway that results in the award lapsing if not met

¼

Deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory
requirements. These awards vest in instalments on anniversaries of the award date speciﬁed at the time of grant. Deferred awards are not
subject to any plan limit. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice

¼

Restricted share awards, made outside of the annual performance process as replacement buy-out awards to new joiners who forfeit awards
on leaving their previous employers, vest in instalments on the anniversaries of the award date speciﬁed at the time of grant. This enables
the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice. In line with similar plans operated by our
competitors, restricted share awards are not subject to an annual limit and do not have any performance measures

¼

Underpin shares are subject to a combination of two performance measures: EPS growth and RoRWA. The weighting between the two
elements is split equally, one-half of the award depending on each measure, assessed independently. These awards vest after three or ﬁve
years. Underpin shares formed part of the variable remuneration awarded to executive directors and senior management in respect of 2014
performance

Directors’ report

¼

Under the 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award. The remaining life of the 2011 Plan during which new awards can be made
is three years.

Dividend equivalents accrue on the 2017 awards during the vesting period, so no discount is applied. However, for the 2018 awards, no dividend
equivalents accrue and the fair value takes this into account, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.

Valuation – deferred shares and restricted shares
The fair value for deferred awards which are not granted to material risk takers is based on 100 per cent of the face value of the shares at the
date of grant as the share price will reﬂect expectations of all future dividends. For awards granted to material risk takers in 2018, the fair value
of awards takes into account the lack of dividend equivalents, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.

Supplementary information

Deferred shares and underpin shares accrue dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period. Details of deferred, underpin and LTIP
awards for executive directors can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Valuation – LTIP awards
The vesting of awards granted in both 2017 and 2018 is subject to the satisfaction of RoE (subject to a capital underpin) and relative TSR
performance measures and achievement of a strategic scorecard. The fair value of the TSR component is calculated using the probability of
meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of shares expected to vest is
evaluated at each reporting date, based on the expected performance against the RoE and strategic measures in the scorecard, to determine
the accounting charge.

Annual Report 2018

2001 Performance Share Plan (2001 PSP) – now closed to new grants:
The Group’s previous plan for delivering performance shares was the 2001 PSP and there remain outstanding vested awards. Under the 2001
PSP half the award was dependent upon TSR performance and the balance was subject to a target of deﬁned EPS growth. Both measures
used the same three-year period and were assessed independently.

Strategic report

31. Share-based payments continued

2006 Restricted Share Scheme (2006 RSS)/2007 Supplementary Restricted Share Scheme (2007 SRSS):
The Group’s previous plans for delivering restricted shares were the 2006 RSS and 2007 SRSS, both now replaced by the 2011 Plan. There
remain outstanding vested awards under these plans. Awards were generally in the form of nil cost options and did not have any performance
measures. Generally deferred restricted share awards vested equally over three years and for non-deferred awards half vested two years after
the date of grant and the balance after three years. No further awards will be granted under the 2006 RSS and 2007 SRSS.

Directors’ report

2013 Sharesave Plan:
Under the 2013 Sharesave Plan, employees may open a savings contract. Within a period of six months after the third anniversary, employees
may purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of invitation (this is known as
the option exercise price). There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the 2013 Sharesave Plan and no grant price
is payable to receive an option. In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to
securities law and regulatory restrictions. In these countries, where possible, the Group offers an equivalent cash-based plan to its employees.
The 2013 Sharesave Plan was approved by Shareholders in May 2013 and all future Sharesave invitations are made under this plan.
The remaining life of the 2013 Sharesave Plan is four years.
Valuation – Sharesave:
Options under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binomial option-pricing model. The same fair value is applied to all employees including
executive directors. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years, or three years prior to grant. The expected life is the average
expected period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life. The expected dividend yield is based on historical dividend for three years prior to grant.

32. Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates
Accounting policy
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities, which the Group controls. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of power is based on the Group’s practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity unilaterally for the Group’s own
beneﬁt and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from
the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest
in the subsidiary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.
Associates and joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligations of the joint arrangement (joint operations),
or have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement (joint venture). The Group evaluates the contractual terms of joint arrangements to
determine whether a joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. As at 31 December 2017, the Group did not have any contractual
interest in joint operations.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Group’s investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identiﬁed on acquisition (net of any accumulated impairment loss).
The Group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post-acquisition proﬁts or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share
of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or
exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the associates and joint ventures. At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence
of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures. Such evidence includes a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in the fair value of
the Group’s investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.
Signifcant accounting estimates and judgements
The Group applies judgement in determining if it has control, joint control or signiﬁcant inﬂuence over subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates respectively. These judgements are based upon identifying the relevant activities of counterparties, being those activities that
signiﬁcantly affect the entities returns, and further making a decision of if the Group has control over those entities, joint control, or has
signiﬁcant inﬂuence (being the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions but not control them).
These judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings. However, further
considerations including but not limited to board seats, advisory committee members and specialist knowledge of some decision-makers
are also taken into account.
Impairment testing of investments in associates and joint arrangements is based on estimates including forecasting the expected cash ﬂows
from the investments and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash ﬂows. The estimation of future cash ﬂows
and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires signiﬁcant judgement.

320

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Accounting policy continued
Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together
with the fair value of any contingent consideration payable. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of
the identiﬁable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill (see Note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the
Group). If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the difference
is recognised directly in the income statement.

Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders
and are reported in equity. Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the
acquisition date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.

Directors’ report

Where the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired have been determined provisionally, or where contingent
or deferred consideration is payable, adjustments arising from their subsequent ﬁnalisation are not reﬂected in the income statement if (i) they
arise within 12 months of the acquisition date (or relate to acquisitions completed before 1 January 2014) and (ii) the adjustments arise from
better information about conditions existing at the acquisition date (measurement period adjustments). Such adjustments are applied as
at the date of acquisition and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated. All changes that are not measurement period adjustments
are reported in income other than changes in contingent consideration not classiﬁed as ﬁnancial instruments, which are accounted for in
accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent consideration classiﬁed as equity, which is not remeasured.

Strategic report

32. Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued

In the Company’s ﬁnancial statements, investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are held at cost less impairment and
dividends from pre-acquisition proﬁts received prior to 1 January 2009, if any. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains
and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the Group accounts.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings

While the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to local statutory capital and liquidity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these
restrictions arise in the normal course of business and do not signiﬁcantly restrict the Group’s ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities
of the Group.
The Group does not have signiﬁcant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities other than those resulting from
the regulatory framework within which the banking subsidiaries operate. These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels
of regulatory capital, liquid assets, exposure limits and comply with other required ratios. These restrictions are summarised below:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

32. Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued
Regulatory and liquidity requirements
The Group’s subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital, leverage ratios, liquidity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the
ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or other assets to the parent company.
The subsidiaries are also required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate.
At 31 December 2018, the total cash and balances with central banks was $58 billion (31 December 2017: $59 billion) of which $8 billion
(31 December 2017: $10 billion) is restricted.
Statutory requirements
The Group’s subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised proﬁts to the parent company,
generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends to the Group. Certain subsidiaries are
also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrictions on exporting capital from the country other than through normal
dividends.
Contractual requirements
The encumbered assets in the balance sheet of the Group’s subsidiaries are not available for transfer around the Group. Encumbered assets are
disclosed in Risk review and Capital review (page 187).

In December 2016 Permata established a portfolio of non-performing loans that were beyond its risk appetite which were to be liquidated.
This resulted in an incremental impairment of $140 million, representing the difference between the carrying amount of the liquidation portfolio
on a hold to collect basis and the amount expected to be realised upon liquidation. This is consistent with the Group’s restructuring actions.
Accordingly, in 2016 the Group has recorded its $62 million share of this incremental impairment as restructuring and this was normalised
from the underlying results of the Group. In 2017 a gain of $59 million has been recognised in restructuring as a result of recoveries on these
non-performing loans.

The Group’s interest in Permata was tested for impairment. The recoverable amount is based on estimates including forecasting the expected
cash ﬂows from the investments and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash ﬂows. At 31 December 2018,
the recoverable amount of the interest in Permata exceeded its carrying amount, and no impairment provision was required.

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Accounting policy
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the
entity. Contractual arrangements determine the rights and therefore relevant activities of the structured entity. Structured entities are generally
created to achieve a narrow and well-deﬁned objective with restrictions around their activities. Structured entities are consolidated when
the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entity indicates the Group has power over the contractual relevant
activities of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.

Judgement is required in determining control over structured entities. The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a
determination of what the relevant activities are of the entity and who directs these. Further judgements are made around which investor is
exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity. The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether
the Group, or another involved party is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others. Judgement is further required
in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities, speciﬁcally if market conditions have an effect on the variable return exposure
of different investors.

Directors’ report

In determining whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its ability to
direct the relevant activities of the structured entity. These relevant activities are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liquidate the
structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds speciﬁc
subordinate securities that embody certain controlling rights. The Group may further consider relevant activities embedded within contractual
arrangements such as call options which give the practical ability to direct the entity, special relationships between the structured entity and
investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.

33. Structured entities

The table below presents the carrying amount of the assets recognised in the ﬁnancial statements relating to variable interests held in
unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities.
Maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the Group’s on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity.
For derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount. For commitments
and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Interests in unconsolidated structured entities: Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by the Group.
The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions
and for speciﬁc investment opportunities. An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability
of the returns of the Group arising from the performance of the structured entity.

Risk review and capital review

Interests in consolidated structured entities: A structured entity is consolidated into the Group’s ﬁnancial statements where the Group
controls the structured entity, as per the determination in the accounting policy above.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

33. Structured entities continued
The main types of activities for which the Group utilises unconsolidated structured entities cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed
investment funds (including specialised Principal Finance funds), portfolio management purposes, structured ﬁnance and asset-backed
securities. These are detailed as follows:
¼

Asset-backed securities (ABS): The Group also has investments in asset-backed securities issued by third-party structured entities as set
out in the Risk review and Capital review (page 174). For the purpose of market making and at the discretion of ABS trading desk, the Group
may hold an immaterial amount of debt securities from structured entities originated by credit portfolio management. This is disclosed in the
ABS column above
–

Portfolio management (Group sponsored entities): For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via
synthetic credit default swaps from note-issuing structured entities. The referenced assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet as they are
not assigned to these structured entities. The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets. The credit
protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securitisation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of
eligible credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Group’s balance sheet. The Group does not hold any equity
interests in the structured entities, but may hold an insigniﬁcant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes. This is disclosed
in the ABS section above. The proceeds of the notes’ issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuer’s account operated by a
trustee or invested in AAA-rated government-backed securities to collateralise the structured entities swap obligations to the Group, and to
repay the principal to investors at maturity. The structured entities reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the
cash collateral or realisation of the collateral security. Correspondingly, the structured entities write down the notes issued by an equal
amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of seniority. All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no
indirect exposure in respect of the vehicles’ liquidity position. The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management
vehicles and investment funds either because the Group is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entities have
Standard Chartered branding

¼

Structured ﬁnance: Structured ﬁnance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured,
using one or more structured entities, which provide beneﬁcial arrangements for customers. The Group’s exposure primarily represents the
provision of funding to these structures as a ﬁnancial intermediary, for which it receives a lender’s return. The transactions largely relate to the
provision of aircraft leasing and ship ﬁnance

¼

Principal Finance funds: The Group’s exposure to Principal Finance funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged
investment funds, primarily investing in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity

¼

Other activities: Other activities include structured entities created to support margin ﬁnancing transactions, the reﬁnancing of existing credit
and debt facilities, as well as setting up of bankruptcy remote structured entities

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

A ﬁnal dividend for 2018 of 15 cents per ordinary share was declared by the directors after 31 December 2018.
On 21 February 2019 the Board of the Company approved an entity reorganisation in which it will acquire the direct ownership of Standard
Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited currently held by wholly owned subsidiary undertakings Standard Chartered Bank and Standard
Chartered Holdings Limited. This common control transaction will have no ﬁnancial impact on the consolidated accounts of the Group. In the
Company only accounts, Investments in Subsidiaries will increase with a corresponding increase in equity being the dividend in specie utilised
to achieve the reorganisation. The transaction is subject to Standard Chartered Bank and Standard Chartered Holdings Limited passing
necessary resolutions for the dividends in specie and completing the necessary transfers, which are expected to be completed in March 2019.

Impairment of ﬁnancial instruments
Impairment of ﬁnancial instruments is performed on an incurred loss basis, when there is objective evidence of impairment.

Strategic report

41. Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is
impaired. A ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event), and that loss event
(or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Impairment of loans and receivables and held-to-maturity ﬁnancial instruments.

Once a loan starts to exhibit credit deterioration, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classiﬁed as
Credit Grade (CG) 12, the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will be performed by Group Special Asset Management (GSAM).

Directors’ report

Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking
The assessment of the credit risk of corporate and commercial loans is done by the Credit Risk department, based upon counterparty
information they receive from various sources including relationship managers and on external market information, or as soon as payment
of interest or principal is 90 days overdue.

Where GSAM’s assessment indicates that a loan is impaired, GSAM will calculate an Individual Impairment Provision (IIP) based on
estimated cash ﬂows revised to reﬂect anticipated recoveries. GSAM’s assessment and calculation of impairment involves a signiﬁcant
level of judgement.

The individual circumstances of each client are taken into account when GSAM estimates future cash ﬂows. All available sources, such as
cash ﬂow arising from operations, selling assets or subsidiaries, realising collateral or payments under guarantees are considered. In any
decision relating to the raising of provisions, the Group attempts to balance economic conditions, local knowledge and experience, and the
results of independent asset reviews.

Risk review and capital review

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a loan and receivable or a held-to-maturity asset has occurred, the amount of the
loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows (excluding
future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is
reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. If a loan and receivable
or held-to-maturity asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate
determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using
an observable market price.

The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows of a collateralised ﬁnancial asset reﬂects the cash ﬂows that may result
from foreclosure, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.

The performing loan portfolio is subject to a Portfolio Impairment Provision (PIP) to cover latent losses i.e. those that are not speciﬁcally
identiﬁed but are known, by experience, to be present in any performing portfolio. The PIP is based on models using risk sizing (including
probability of default and loss given default), environmental parameters and exceptional adjustment overlays. The calculation of the PIP uses
regulatory expected credit loss (ECL) models. ECL is subject to an emergence risk factor that is generally understood as the hypothetical
amount of time between a loss event occurrence and the bank recognition of impairment. The emergence risk factor is the principal means
of translating a risk position to an impairment estimate, and the main scaling factor to adjust the conservative regulatory expected loss to
an effective PIP level, as the regulatory ECL models are more punitive than the incurred loss model under IAS 39. On a portfolio basis, the
emergence risk factor ranges between two and three months based on structural economic drivers that might inﬂuence the accurate and
timely discovery of credit issues in each country.

A credit obligation in Retail Banking clients portfolio that is more than 150 Days Past Due (DPD) or, a credit obligation secured by Wealth
Management products that is 90DPD, is recognised as ‘impaired’ and IIP is provided for accordingly. There are, however, exceptions to
this rule for portfolios where empirical evidence suggests that they should be set more conservatively. In addition, the credit account is
recognised as ‘impaired’ immediately if the borrower ﬁles for bankruptcy or other equivalent forbearance programme, or the borrower is
deceased, or the business is closed in the case of small business clients, or the borrower’s other credit accounts with the Group are
impaired. The core components of the IIP calculation are the value of gross charge-off and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or provisions
are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay. Recovery of unsecured debt post-impairment is recognised based
on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to third-party institutions. Provision release of
secured loans post-impairment is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full (release of full provision), or the provision is higher than the
loan outstanding (release of the excess provision), or the loan is paid to current and remains in current for more than 180 days (release of
full provision).

Supplementary information

Retail Banking
An IIP is recognised for Retail Banking when an account meets a deﬁned threshold condition in terms of overdue payments (‘contractual
default’) or meets other objective conditions (such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death) as further described above in the
assessment factors. The threshold conditions are set at the point where empirical evidence suggests that the client is unlikely to meet their
contractual obligations or a loss of principal is expected.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In cases where the impairment assessment indicates that there will be a loss of principal, the loan is graded CG14 while other impaired loans
will be graded CG13. Loans graded CG13–CG14 are classiﬁed as non-performing loans.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the
ﬁnancial statements

41. Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued
Retail Banking continued
Retail Banking PIP, covering the inherent losses in the portfolio that exist at the balance sheet date but have not been individually identiﬁed, is
computed on performing loans (no IIP), using Expected Loss (EL) rates, to determine latent losses in the portfolio. The EL utilises probability
of default and loss given default inherent within the portfolio of impaired loans or receivables and the historical loss experience for assets with
credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Group. For defaulted yet non-impaired accounts (greater than 90 days past due) full EL is
used, while for non-defaulted accounts, a three month emergence period is applied. An adjustment is added to the PIP calculation to take
into the account instances where the EL-based PIP is deemed imprecise due to under-prediction or over-prediction of EL by underlying
models. An overlay in the form of Special Risk Adjustment (SRA) is added to the EL-based PIP calculation to take into account instances
where EL-based PIP is deemed insufﬁcient to incorporate the impact of a speciﬁc credit event. An overlay in the form of Business Cycle
Adjustment (BCA) is taken to account for the impact of cyclical volatility in the operating environment, which is not adequately covered in
the underlying models.
Impairment of available-for-sale fnancial instruments
Where objective evidence of impairment exists for available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, the cumulative loss (measured as the difference between
the amortised cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that ﬁnancial asset previously recognised in the income statement)
is reclassiﬁed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial instruments
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into the following measurement categories: ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss;
loans and receivables; held-to-maturity; or available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as either held at fair value through proﬁt or loss or at amortised cost.
Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
The following details the approach for the categories:
a) Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or loss: This category has two sub-categories:
¼

Financial assets and liabilities held for trading: A ﬁnancial asset or liability is classiﬁed as held for trading if acquired principally for the
purpose of selling in the short term, or forms part of a portfolio of ﬁnancial instruments which are managed together and for which there is
evidence of short-term proﬁt-taking or is a derivative (excluding qualifying hedging relationships)

¼

Designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss: Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss when:

¼

The designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring
assets or liabilities on a different basis (for example, the Group may designate certain ﬁxed rate loans and receivables that are managed
with derivative interest rate swaps)

¼

A group of ﬁnancial assets and/or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis (for example, the Group may
designate issued debt to fund a portfolio of trading assets and liabilities that are all managed on a fair value basis)

¼

The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately

b) Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and
it is expected that apart from credit deterioration substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered.
c) Held-to-maturity assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that the Group’s
management has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
d) Available-for-sale assets are those non-derivative ﬁnancial assets intended to be held for an indeﬁnite period of time, which may be sold in
response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.
e) Financial liabilities held at amortised cost: Financial liabilities, which include borrowings not classiﬁed as held at fair value through proﬁt
or loss, are classiﬁed as amortised cost instruments. Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate
of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a speciﬁc date or at the option of the shareholders, are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial
liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds. The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement
as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Initial recognition of fnancial instruments
All ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price plus, for those ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
not carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value taken directly to the net trading income line in the income statement except for changes in fair value on ﬁnancial liabilities designated at
fair value attributable to the Group’s own credit presented directly within other comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to the available-for
sale reserve within equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between proceeds net of directly attributable transaction costs and the
redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
In addition to these instruments, the carrying value of a ﬁnancial instrument carried at amortised cost that is the hedged item in a qualifying
fair value hedge relationship is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.

41. Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued

1 FVTPL ﬁnancial assets have increased due to reclassiﬁcations of $44,608 million of reverse repurchase agreements (IAS 39: loans and receivables), $1,244 million of loans and
advances to banks and customers (IAS 39: loans and receivables), $511 million of investment debt securities (IAS 39: available-for sale) and $684 million of equity shares (IAS 39:
available-for-sale), with the remaining $29 million being IFRS 9 re-measurement adjustments. Repurchase agreements of $38,144 million have been reclassiﬁed from amortised cost
under IAS 39 to FVTPL
2 The Group’s initial estimate of credit impairment provisions on adoption of IFRS 9 was $6,720 million. Following reﬁnement of the Group’s expected loss models, the estimate of the
opening credit impairment provisions has been revised down by $222 million to $6,498 million, and the net expected credit loss of $(1,296) million adjusted against retained earnings
has similarly decreased by $222 million to $(1,074) million

1 Available-for-sale category has been removed under IFRS 9. Unrealised gains and losses have been transferred to fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserves,
or retained earnings where the instruments are held as FVTPL. The FVOCI reserve includes a $187 million loss in respect of equity securities designated as FVOCI, partly offset by
$18 million gain on debt securities designated as FVOCI
2 The remeasurement impact of ﬁnancial assets that are now measured at fair value under IFRS 9 (page 353)
3 Impact from adopting expected credit losses. Gross impact is estimated at $1,082 million (comprising $1,074 million in retained earnings and $8 million in non-controlling interests).
As FVOCI debt instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet, the expected credit loss charged to retained earnings is recognised as a credit to the FVOCI reserve. The net
FVOCI reserve relating to FVOCI debt instruments will be recycled to the income statement on disposal of the instruments
4 Tax of $173 million has been credited to reserves as a result of transition to IFRS 9. Of this, deferred tax of $142 million has been credited to retained earnings, and is provided on
additional deductible temporary differences that have arisen from loss provisions due to initial adoption of the expected credit loss approach

What made this photograph so beautiful was
that both the ﬁshermen were so focused
on fulﬁlling their dreams. They were aware of
the odds, yet committed to their goals and
living a life of purpose. They knew they were
responsible to fulﬁl each other’s potential.
They understood what it really meant to
work together.
The photograph truly resonates because I live
by the Helen Keller quote “Alone we can do
so little; together we can do so much”. In my
team, we believe we are #BetterTogether
because we set strong objectives, we are
open and transparent, we work together
to make better decisions, we manage risks,
we stay focused, we make ourselves more
efﬁcient and we serve our clients better.

Average balance sheets and yields and volume and price variances
Average balance sheets and yield
The following tables set out the average balances and yields for the Group’s assets and liabilities for the years ended 31 December 2018 and
31 December 2017. For the purpose of these tables, average balances have been determined on the basis of daily balances, except for certain

the opening credit impairment provisions has been revised down by Rs.15,494 million to Rs.453,510 million, and the net expected credit loss of Rs.(90,451) million adjusted against
retained earnings has similarly decreased by Rs.15,494 million to Rs.74,957 million

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

The condensed consolidated interim ﬁnancial
statements of the Group for the year ended
31 December 2018 with comparatives
as at 31 December 2017 are prepared in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS
Interpretations Committee interpretations
as adopted by the European Union.

IFRS (IAS 8 Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates
and Errors)
Changes in accounting policy are applied
retrospectively. Comparatives are restated
and the effect of period(s) not presented is
adjusted against opening retained earnings
of the earliest year presented. Policy changes
made on the adoption of a new standard are
made in accordance with that standard’s
transitional provisions.

Where a change in accounting policy has
a material effect in the current period, the
amount by which any item in the ﬁnancial
statements is affected by such change
should also be disclosed to the extent
ascertainable. Where such an amount is not
ascertainable, this fact should be indicated.

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated
at the closing rate at the date of that
statement of ﬁnancial position. Income
statement items are translated at the
exchange rate at the date of transaction or
at average rates. The functional currency
is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which an entity operates.
The functional and presentation currency
of the Group is US dollars.
Indian GAAP (AS 11 The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)
There is no concept of functional or
presentation currency. Entities in India have
to prepare their ﬁnancial statements in
Indian rupees.
A foreign currency transaction should be
recorded, on initial recognition in the reporting
currency, by applying to the foreign currency
amount, the exchange rate between the
reporting currency and the foreign currency
at the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date:
¼

Foreign currency monetary items should
be reported using the closing rate

¼

Non-monetary items which are carried in
terms of historical cost denominated in
a foreign currency should be reported
using the exchange rate at the date of
the transaction

¼

Non-monetary items which are carried
at fair value or other similar valuation
denominated in a foreign currency should
be reported using the exchange rates that
existed when the values were determined

Financial statements

Indian GAAP (AS 5 Net Proﬁt or Loss
for the Period, Prior Period Items and
Changes in Accounting Policies)
The cumulative amount of the change is
included in the income statement for the
period in which the change is made except
as speciﬁed in certain standards (transitional
provision) where the change during the
transition period resulting from adoption
of the standard has to be adjusted
against opening retained earnings and
the impact disclosed.

IFRS (IAS 21 The Effects of Changes
in Foreign Exchange Rates)
An entity may present its ﬁnancial statements
in any currency (or currencies). If the
presentation currency differs from the
entity’s functional currency, it translates
its results and ﬁnancial position into the
presentation currency.

Risk review and capital review
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Set out below are descriptions of certain
accounting differences between IFRS and
Indian GAAP that could have a signiﬁcant
effect on proﬁt or loss attributable to parent
company shareholders for the period ended
31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017
and total parent company shareholders’
equity as at the same dates. This section
does not provide a comprehensive analysis
of such differences. In particular, this
description considers only those Indian
GAAP pronouncements for which adoption
or application is required in ﬁnancial
statements for years ended on or prior to
31 December 2018. The Group has not
quantiﬁed the effect of differences between
IFRS and Indian GAAP, nor prepared
consolidated ﬁnancial statements under
Indian GAAP, nor undertaken a reconciliation
of IFRS and Indian GAAP ﬁnancial
statements. Had the Group undertaken
any such quantiﬁcation or preparation or
reconciliation, other potentially signiﬁcant
accounting and disclosure differences may
have come to its attention which are not
identiﬁed below. Accordingly, the Group
does not provide any assurance that the
differences identiﬁed below represent all
the principal differences between IFRS
and Indian GAAP relating to the Group.
Furthermore, no attempt has been made to
identify future differences between IFRS and
Indian GAAP. In addition, no attempt has
been made to identify all differences between
IFRS and Indian GAAP that may affect the
ﬁnancial statements as a result of transaction
or events that may occur in the future.

Directors’ report

IFRS differs in certain signiﬁcant respects
from Indian Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). Such differences involve
methods for measuring the amounts shown
in the ﬁnancial statements of the Group, as
well as additional disclosures required by
Indian GAAP.

In making an investment decision,
potential investors should consult their
own professional advisers for an
understanding of the differences between
IFRS and Indian GAAP and how those
differences may have affected the ﬁnancial
results of the Group. The summary does
not purport to be complete and is subject
to and qualiﬁed in its entirety by reference
to the pronouncements of the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB),
together with the pronouncements of the
Indian accounting profession.

SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION

Supplementary
ﬁnancial information

Consolidation
IFRS (IFRS 10 Consolidated
Financial Statements)
Entities are consolidated when the Group
controls an entity. The Group controls an
entity when it is exposed to or has rights to
direct relevant activities, or has the right to
variable returns from its involvement with
the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the investee.
This also includes entities where control is
not derived through voting rights such as
structured entities.
Indian GAAP (AS 21 Consolidated
Financial Statements)
Guidance is based on the power through the
ability to govern the ﬁnancial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts
while not taking into consideration potential
voting rights.
No speciﬁc guidance is given by Indian GAAP
on consolidation of structured entities.

Business combinations
IFRS (IFRS 3 Business Combinations)
All business combinations are treated as
acquisitions. Assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired are measured at their fair
values with the excess over this fair value
when compared with the acquisition cost
recognised as goodwill.
For acquisitions occurring on or after
1 January 2004, IFRS 3 requires that,
when assessing the value of the assets
of an acquired entity, certain identiﬁable
intangible assets must be recognised and,
if considered to have a ﬁnite life, amortised
through the income statement over an
appropriate period.
Adjustments to provisional fair values are
permitted provided those adjustments are
made within 12 months from the date of
acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment
to goodwill. After re-assessment of respective
fair values of net assets acquired, any excess
of acquirer’s interest in the net fair values of
acquirer’s identiﬁable assets is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
The Group’s policy for non-controlling
interests is generally not to recognise
non-controlling interests at their fair value,
but to recognise them based on their
proportionate share of the fair value of
the identiﬁable net assets acquired.

372

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Indian GAAP (AS 14 Accounting
for Amalgamations)
Treatment of a business combination
depends on whether the acquired entity
is held as a subsidiary, whether it is an
amalgamation or whether it is an acquisition
of a business. For an entity acquired and held
as a subsidiary, the business combination is
accounted for as an acquisition. The assets
and liabilities acquired are incorporated at
their existing carrying amounts.
For an amalgamation of an entity, either
pooling of interests or acquisition accounting
may be used. The assets and liabilities
amalgamated are incorporated at their
existing carrying amounts or, alternatively,
if acquisition accounting is adopted, the
consideration can be allocated to individual
identiﬁable assets (which may include
intangible assets) and liabilities on the basis
of their fair values.
Adjustments to the value of acquired or
amalgamated balances are not permitted
after initial recognition. Any excess of
acquirer’s interest in the net fair values of
acquirer’s identiﬁable assets is recognised as
capital reserve, which is neither amortised
nor available for distribution to shareholders.
However, in case of an amalgamation
accounted under the purchase method, the
fair value of intangible assets with no active
market is reduced to the extent of capital
reserve, if any, arising on the amalgamation.
Minority interests arising on the acquisition
of a subsidiary are recognised at their share
of the historical book value.

Goodwill
IFRS (IFRS 3 Business Combinations
and IAS 38 Intangible Assets)
IFRS 3 requires that goodwill arising on all
acquisitions by the Group and associated
undertakings is capitalised but not amortised
and is subject to an annual review for
impairment. Goodwill is tested annually
for impairment. Any impairment losses
recognised may not be reversed in
subsequent accounting periods.

Indian GAAP (AS 14 Accounting
for Amalgamations and AS 26
Intangible Assets)
Goodwill arising on amalgamations is
capitalised and amortised over useful life not
exceeding ﬁve years, unless a longer period
can be justiﬁed. For goodwill arising on
acquisition of a subsidiary or a business,
there is no speciﬁc guidance. In practice,
there is either no amortisation or amortisation
not exceeding 10 years. Goodwill is reviewed
for impairment whenever an indicator of
impairment exists. Impairment losses
recognised may be reversed under
exceptional circumstances only in
subsequent accounting periods through
the income statement.

Acquired and internally
generated intangible assets
IFRS (IAS 38 Intangible Assets)
Intangible assets are recognised if they
are deemed separable and arise from
contractual or other legal rights. Assets
with a ﬁnite useful life are amortised on
a systematic basis over their useful life.
An asset with an indeﬁnite useful life
should be tested for impairment annually.
Indian GAAP (AS 26 Intangible Assets)
Intangible assets are capitalised if speciﬁc
criteria are met and are amortised over their
useful life, generally not exceeding 10 years.
The recoverable amount of an intangible
asset that is not available for use or is being
amortised over a period exceeding 10 years
should be reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial
year end even if there is no indication that the
asset is impaired.

Property, plant and equipment
IFRS (IAS 16 Property, Plant and
Equipment, IAS 23 Borrowing Costs)
The Group’s policy is to hold all property,
plant, aviation, shipping and equipment
ﬁxed assets at cost less depreciation and
consequently tangible ﬁxed assets are not
subject to revaluation. Fixed assets are,
however, subject to impairment testing.
Foreign exchange gains or losses relating
to the procurement of property, plant and
equipment can be capitalised as part of the
asset. Depreciation is recorded over the
asset’s estimated useful life. Borrowing costs
that are directly attributable to the acquisition
or construction of an asset must be
capitalised as part of that asset.

Recognition and measurement
of ﬁnancial instruments

Conversely, ﬁnancial assets that have SPPI
characteristics but are held within a business
model whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling
ﬁnancial assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) are
classiﬁed as FVOCI.
Equity instruments designated
as FVOCI
Non-trading equity instruments acquired
for strategic purposes rather than capital
gain may be irrevocably designated at initial
recognition at FVOCI on an instrument-byinstrument basis. Gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of these
instruments, including foreign exchange gains
and losses, are recognised directly in equity
and are never reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss,
even on derecognition.

¼

Hybrid ﬁnancial assets that contain one
or more embedded derivatives

¼

Financial assets that would otherwise be
measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but
which do not have SPPI characteristics

¼

Equity instruments that have not been
designated as held at FVOCI

¼

Financial liabilities that constitute
contingent consideration in a business
combination

Designated at fair value through proﬁt
or loss
Financial assets and liabilities may be
designated at fair value through proﬁt or
loss when the designation eliminates or
signiﬁcantly reduces a measurement or
recognition inconsistency that would
otherwise arise from measuring assets or
liabilities on a different basis (‘accounting
mismatch’).
Financial liabilities may also be designated
at fair value through proﬁt or loss where they
are managed on a fair value basis or have a
bifurcately embedded derivative where the
Group is not able to separately value the
embedded derivative component.
Financial liabilities held at
amortised cost
Financial liabilities that are not ﬁnancial
guarantees or loan commitments and that
are not classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities held at
fair value through proﬁt or loss are classiﬁed
as ﬁnancial liabilities held at amortised cost.
Financial guarantee contracts and
loan commitments
Financial guarantee contracts and loan
commitments issued at below market interest
rates are initially recognised as liabilities at fair
value and subsequently at the higher of the
expected credit loss provision, and the
amount initially recognised less the
cumulative amount of income recognised in
accordance with the principles of IFRS 15
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Financial assets and liabilities held at
fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets that are not held at
amortised cost or which are not held at fair
value through other comprehensive income
are held at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are either mandatorily
classiﬁed fair value through proﬁt or loss or
irrevocably designated at fair value through
proﬁt or loss at initial recognition.

Financial assets and liabilities held for
trading, which are those acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in
the short term

Financial statements

Financial assets held at amortised
cost and fair value through other
comprehensive income
Debt instruments held at amortised cost or
held at fair value through comprehensive
income (FVOCI) have contractual terms
that give rise to cash ﬂows that are solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI
characteristics). Principal is the fair value of
the ﬁnancial asset at initial recognition but this
may change over the life of the instrument
as amounts are repaid. Interest consists of
consideration for the time value of money, for
the credit risk associated with the principal
amount outstanding during a particular
period and for other basic lending risks
and costs, as well as a proﬁt margin.

Financial assets that have SPPI
characteristics and which are held within a
business model whose objective is to hold
ﬁnancial assets to collect contractual cash
ﬂows (‘hold to collect’) are recorded at
amortised cost.

IFRS – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
Classifcation and measurement
Accounting policy
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into
the following measurement categories:
amortised cost; fair value through other
comprehensive income; and fair value
through proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are
classiﬁed as either amortised cost, or held at
fair value through proﬁt or loss. Management
determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial
assets and liabilities at initial recognition of
the instrument or, where applicable, at the
time of reclassiﬁcation.

The Group makes an assessment of the
objective of a business model in which
an asset is held at the individual product
business line, and where applicable within
business lines depending on the way the
business is managed and information is
provided to management.

Mandatorily classiﬁed at fair value
through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets and liabilities that are
mandatorily held at fair value through proﬁt
or loss include:

Directors’ report

Indian GAAP (AS 10 Fixed Assets,
AS 16 Borrowing Cost and AS 6
Depreciation Accounting)
Fixed assets are recorded at historical costs
or revalued amounts. Relevant borrowing
costs are capitalised if certain criteria in
AS 16 are met. Depreciation is recorded over
the asset’s useful life. Schedule II (Part C)
of the Companies Act 2013 and Banking
Regulations prescribe minimum rates of
depreciation and these are typically used
as the basis for determining useful life.

Whether ﬁnancial assets are held at
amortised cost or at FVOCI depends on the
objectives of the business models under
which the assets are held. A business model
refers to how the Group manages ﬁnancial
assets to generate cash ﬂows.

Recognition and measurement
of ﬁnancial instruments continued
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities
Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date in the
principal market for the asset or liability, or in
the absence of a principal market, the most
advantageous market to which the Group
has access at that date. The fair value of a
liability includes the risk that the Group will
not be able to honour its obligations.
Initial recognition
Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities held at fair value through proﬁt or
loss, and debt securities classiﬁed as ﬁnancial
assets held at FVOCI are initially recognised
on the trade-date (the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset).
Loans and advances and other ﬁnancial
assets held at amortised cost are recognised
on the settlement date (the date on which
cash is advanced to the borrowers).
All ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised
at fair value, which is normally the transaction
price, plus directly attributable transaction
costs for ﬁnancial assets that are not
subsequently measured at fair value through
proﬁt or loss.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets and fnancial liabilities
held at amortised cost
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities held at
amortised cost are subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets held at FVOCI
Debt instruments held at FVOCI are
subsequently carried at fair value, with all
unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in fair value (including any related
foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised
in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in a separate component of
equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on
the amortised cost are recognised in income.
Changes in expected credit losses are
recognised in the proﬁt or loss and are
accumulated in a separate component
of equity.

374

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Equity investments designated at FVOCI are
subsequently carried at fair value with all
unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in fair value (including any related
foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised
in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in a separate component
of equity.
Financial assets and liabilities mandatorily
held at fair value through proﬁt or loss and
ﬁnancial assets designated at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are subsequently
carried at fair value, with gains and losses
arising from changes in fair value recorded
in the net trading income line in the income
statement unless the instrument is part of a
cash ﬂow hedging relationship. Contractual
interest income on ﬁnancial assets held at fair
value through proﬁt or loss is recognised as
interest income in a separate line in the
income statement.
Financial liabilities designated at fair value
through proft or loss
Financial liabilities designated at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are held at fair value,
with changes in fair value recognised in the
net trading income line in the proﬁt or loss,
other than that attributable to changes in
credit risk. Fair value changes attributable
to credit risk are recognised in other
comprehensive income and recorded in a
separate category of reserves unless this is
expected to create or enlarge an accounting
mismatch, in which case the entire change in
fair value of the ﬁnancial liability designated
fair value through proﬁt or loss is recognised
in proﬁt or loss.
Indian GAAP (AS 13 Investments)
AS 13 requires investments to be categorised
as follows:
¼

¼

Current investments, which are those
readily realisable and intended to be held
for less than one year, are carried at the
lower of cost and fair value, with changes
in fair value taken directly to proﬁt or loss
Long-term investments, which are those
investments not classiﬁed as current, are
carried at cost unless there is a permanent
diminution in value, in which case a
provision for diminution is required to be
made by the entity

For investments, the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) outlines similar classiﬁcations
to IFRS, but the classiﬁcation criteria and
measurement requirements differ from those
set out in IFRS. Financial liabilities are usually
carried at cost. There is no ability to designate
instruments at fair value.

Derivatives
IFRS (IFRS 9/IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement)
IFRS 9 requires that all derivatives be
recognised on-balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that
are not hedges are reported in the income
statement. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated as hedges
are either offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged asset or liability through
earnings, or recognised directly in equity until
the hedged item is recognised in earnings,
depending on the nature of the hedge.
The ineffective portion of the hedge’s change
in fair value is immediately recognised in
earnings. A derivative may only be classiﬁed
as a hedge if an entity meets stringent
qualifying criteria in respect of documentation
and hedge effectiveness.
The Group continues to apply the hedge
accounting requirements of IAS 39 rather
than the requirements of IFRS 9.
Indian GAAP
Foreign exchange contracts held for trading
or speculative purposes are carried at fair
value, with gains and losses recognised in the
income statement. In the absence of speciﬁc
guidance, equity options are carried at the
lower of cost or market value.
For banks, there are guidelines prescribed
by RBI on measurement and accounting
of interest rate swaps and forward rate
agreements entered into for hedging
purposes.

Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Under IFRS 9 the impairment of ﬁnancial
assets is as follows:
Measurement
Expected credit losses are computed as
unbiased, probability-weighted amounts
which are determined by evaluating a range
of reasonably possible outcomes, the
time value of money, and considering all
reasonable and supportable information
including that which is forward-looking.
For material portfolios, the estimate of
expected cash shortfalls is determined by
multiplying the probability of default (PD) with
the loss given default (LGD) with the expected
exposure at the time of default (EAD). For less
material Retail Banking loan portfolios, the
Group has adopted simpliﬁed approaches
based on historical roll rates or loss rates.

For credit-impaired ﬁnancial instruments,
the estimate of cash shortfalls may require
the use of expert credit judgement. As a
practical expedient, the Group may also
measure credit impairment on the basis
of an instrument’s fair value using an
observable market price.

Recognition

Loss provisions against credit-impaired
ﬁnancial assets are determined based on an
assessment of the recoverable cash ﬂows
under a range of scenarios, including the
realisation of any collateral held where
appropriate. The loss provisions held
represent the difference between the present
value of the cash ﬂows expected to be
recovered, discounted at the instrument’s
original effective interest rate, and the gross
carrying value of the instrument prior to any
credit impairment.

For loans and advances, the RBI regulations
stipulate minimum provision based on days
past due. Additionally, RBI regulations require
banks to hold provisions in respect of
standard assets and for speciﬁc country
risk exposures.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments
– IFRS 9
Financial assets are derecognised when the
rights to receive cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial
assets have expired or where the Group
has transferred substantially all risks and
rewards of ownership. If substantially all
the risks and rewards have been neither
retained nor transferred and the Group has
retained control, the assets continue to be
recognised to the extent of the Group’s
continuing involvement.
Where ﬁnancial assets have been modiﬁed,
the modiﬁed terms are assessed on a
qualitative and quantitative basis to determine
whether a fundamental change in the nature
of the instrument has occurred, such as
whether the derecognition of the pre-existing
instrument and the recognition of a new
instrument is appropriate.
On derecognition of a ﬁnancial asset, the
difference between the carrying amount of
the asset (or the carrying amount allocated
to the portion of the asset derecognised)
and the sum of the consideration received
(including any new asset obtained less any
new liability assumed) and any cumulative
gain or loss that had been recognised in
other comprehensive income is recognised
in proﬁt or loss except for equity instruments
elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative
fair value adjustments attributable to the
credit risk of a liability that are held in other
comprehensive income.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Signiﬁcant increase in credit risk
(stage 2)
If a ﬁnancial asset experiences a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial
recognition, an expected credit loss provision
is recognised for default events that may
occur over the lifetime of the asset.

Irrevocable lending commitments to a
credit-impaired obligor that have not yet
been drawn down are also included within
the stage 3 credit impairment provision to
the extent that the commitment cannot
be withdrawn.

In accordance with RBI regulations, in
respect of available-for- sale investments,
impairments are required to be reversed
through Investment Reserve Account (equity
reserve) if the investment rises in value or the
reasons for impairment no longer exist.

Financial statements

12 months expected credit losses
(stage 1)
Expected credit losses are recognised at
the time of initial recognition of a ﬁnancial
instrument and represent the lifetime cash
shortfalls arising from possible default events
up to 12 months into the future from the
balance sheet date. Expected credit losses
continue to be determined on this basis until
there is either a signiﬁcant increase in the
credit risk of an instrument or the instrument
becomes credit-impaired. If an instrument is
no longer considered to exhibit a signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk, expected credit
losses will revert to being determined on
a 12-month basis.

Credit-impaired (or defaulted)
exposures (stage 3)
Financial assets that are credit-impaired (or in
default) represent those that are at least 90
days past due in respect of principal and/or
interest. Financial assets are also considered
to be credit-impaired where the obligors are
unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one
or more observable events that have a
detrimental impact on the estimated future
cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset. It may not
be possible to identify a single discrete event
but instead the combined effect of several
events may cause ﬁnancial assets to become
credit-impaired.

Impairments may be reversed through the
income statement in subsequent periods if
the investment rises in value or the reasons
for the impairment no longer exist.

Risk review and capital review

Financial assets held
at amortised cost

Indian GAAP (AS 13 Investments)
Long-term investments are written down
when there is a decline in fair value which is
deemed to be other than temporary.

Directors’ report

Cash shortfalls are discounted using the
effective interest rate on the ﬁnancial
instrument as calculated at initial recognition,
or if the instrument has a variable interest rate,
the current effective interest rate determined
under the contract.

Signiﬁcant increase in credit risk is assessed
by comparing the risk of default of an
exposure at the reporting date to the risk of
default at origination (after taking into account
the passage of time). Signiﬁcant does not
mean statistically signiﬁcant nor is it assessed
in the context of changes in expected credit
loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is
signiﬁcant or not is assessed using a number
of quantitative and qualitative factors, the
weight of which depends on the type of
product and counterparty. Financial assets
that are 30 or more days past due and not
credit-impaired will always be considered to
have experienced a signiﬁcant increase in
credit risk. For less material portfolios where
a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to
compute expected credit loss, signiﬁcant
increase in credit risk is primarily based on
30 days past due.

SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION

Supplementary
ﬁnancial information

Recognition continued
Derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments
– IFRS 9 continued
Financial liabilities are derecognised when
they are extinguished. A ﬁnancial liability is
extinguished when the obligation is
discharged, cancelled or expires and this is
evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively.
However, where a ﬁnancial liability has been
modiﬁed, it is derecognised if the difference
between the modiﬁed cash ﬂows and the
original cash ﬂows is more than 10 per cent.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is
derecognised and the difference between
the carrying amount of the liability and the
consideration paid is included in ‘Other
income’ except for the cumulative fair value
adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a
liability that are held in other comprehensive
income which are never recycled to the proﬁt
or loss.
IFRS – classiﬁcation debt/equity
The substance of a ﬁnancial instrument,
rather than its legal form, governs its
classiﬁcation. A ﬁnancial instrument is
classiﬁed as a liability where there is a
contractual obligation to deliver either cash
or another ﬁnancial asset to the holder of
that instrument, regardless of the manner
in which the contractual obligation will be
settled. Preference shares, which carry
a mandatory coupon or are redeemable
on a speciﬁc date or at the option of the
shareholder are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities
and are presented in other borrowed funds.
The dividends on these preference shares
are recognised in the income statement as
interest expense on an amortised cost basis
using the effective interest method.
Indian GAAP
Classiﬁcation is based on the legal form
rather than substance.

Provisions for liabilities
and charges
IFRS (IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent
Liabilities and Contingent Assets)
The amount recognised as a provision is the
best estimate at the balance sheet date of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation,
discounted using a pre-tax market discount
rate if the effect is material.

376

Standard Chartered
Annual Report 2018

Indian GAAP (AS 29 Provisions,
Contingents Liabilities and
Contingent Assets)
Provisions are recognised and measured
on a similar basis to IFRS, except that there is
no requirement for discounting the provision
or liability.

Pension obligations
IFRS (IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts)
For deﬁned contribution plans, contributions
are charged to operating expenses. For
funded deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the liability
recognised in the balance sheet is the
present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation
at the balance sheet date less the fair value
of plan assets. For unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt
plans the liability recognised at the balance
sheet date is the present value of the
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. The deﬁned
beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected
unit method. The present value of the
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash
outﬂows using an interest rate equal to the
yield on high-quality corporate bonds.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise are
recognised in shareholders’ equity and
presented in the statement of other
comprehensive income in the period they
arise. The net interest expense on the net
deﬁned liability for the year is determined by
applying the discount rate used to measure
the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the beginning
of the annual period to the then net deﬁned
beneﬁt liability, taking into account any
changes in the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability
during the year as a result of contributions
and beneﬁt payment. Net interest expense
and other expense related to deﬁned
beneﬁt plans are recognised in the
income statement.
Indian GAAP (AS 15 Employee Beneﬁts)
The discount rate to be used for determining
deﬁned beneﬁt obligations is established
by reference to market yields at the
balance sheet date on government bonds.
The expected return on plan assets is based
on market expectation for the returns
over the entire life of the related obligation.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised
immediately in the statement of income.

Share-based compensation
IFRS (IFRS 2 Share-based Payments)
IFRS 2 requires that all share-based
payments are accounted for using a fair
value method. The fair value of the employee
services received in exchange for the grant
of the options is recognised as an expense.
For equity-settled awards, the total amount
to be expensed over the vesting period must
be determined by reference to the fair value
of the options granted (determined using an
option pricing model), excluding the impact
of any non-market vesting conditions (for
example, proﬁtability and growth targets).
Non-market vesting conditions must be
included in assumptions about the number
of options that are expected to become
exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the
Group revises its estimates of the number
of options that are expected to become
exercisable. It recognises the impact of the
revision of original estimates, if any, in the
income statement, and a corresponding
adjustment to equity over the remaining
vesting period. The proceeds received net
of any directly attributable transaction costs
are credited to share capital (nominal value)
and share premium when the options
are exercised.
Cash-settled awards must be revalued at
each balance sheet date on an intrinsic value
basis (being the difference between the
market price of the share at the measurement
date and the exercise price) with any changes
in fair value charged or credited to staff costs
in the income statement.
Indian GAAP
Entities may either follow the intrinsic
value method or the fair value method for
determining the costs of beneﬁts arising from
share-based compensation plans. Although
the fair value approach is recommended,
entities may use the intrinsic value method
and provide fair value disclosures.
Deferred tax is not recognised as it is not
considered to represent a timing difference.
Entities are also permitted the option of
recognising the related compensation cost
over the service period for the entire award
(that is, over the service period of the last
separately vesting portion of the award),
provided that the amount of compensation
cost recognised at any date at least equals
the fair value of the vested portion of the
award at that date.

Dividends

IFRS (IAS 12 Income Taxes)
Deferred tax is determined based on
temporary differences, being the difference
between the carrying amount and tax
base of assets and liabilities, subject to
certain exceptions.

IFRS (IAS 10 Events After the
Reporting Date)
Dividends to holders of equity instruments,
when proposed or declared after the balance
sheet date, should not be recognised
as a liability on the balance sheet date.
A company, however, is required to disclose
the amount of dividends that were proposed
or declared after the balance sheet date
but before the ﬁnancial statements were
authorised for issue.

Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is
probable (more likely than not) that sufﬁcient
future taxable proﬁts will be available to utilise
to deferred tax assets.

Indian GAAP
Accounting and disclosure of dividends is
similar to IFRS with effect from 1 April 2016.

Directors’ report

Indian GAAP (AS 22 Accounting for
Taxes on Income)
Deferred tax is determined based on timing
differences, being the difference between
accounting income and taxable income for
a period that is capable of reversal in one
or more subsequent periods.

Strategic report

Deferred taxation

Deferred tax assets are recognised where
it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will
be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Indian GAAP (IAS 9 Revenue
Recognition)
As per IAS 9, interest is recognised on a time
proportion basis taking into account the
amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
In the absence of a speciﬁc effective interest
rate requirement, premiums and discounts
are usually amortised on a straight-line basis
over the term of the instrument.

Financial statements

IFRS (IFRS 9)
Interest income and expense is recognised
in the income statement using the effective
interest method. The effective interest rate
is the rate that discounts estimated future
cash payments or receipts through the
expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument.
When calculating the effective interest rate,
the Group estimates cash ﬂows considering
all contractual terms of the ﬁnancial
instrument but does not consider future
credit losses. The calculation includes all
fees and points paid or received between
parties to the contract that are an integral
part of the effective interest rate, transaction
costs and all other premiums or discounts.

Additional notes on environment data
The emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018. This is to allow sufﬁcient time for
independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to
the same period rather than the calendar year used in ﬁnancial reporting. This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice.
We use measured data to calculate our energy and water use across our properties, which we then scale up to reﬂect the portion of the portfolio
we do not gather measurements from.
Measured data is collected from Global Environment Management System (GEMS) properties, deﬁned as all properties that are over 10,000
square feet for energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is deﬁned per full-time employee.
Scaled-up data represents measured data taken from a sample of branches, which is then extrapolated to reﬂect the Group’s total property
footprint in energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is deﬁned per full-time employee (as at the end of the reporting period).
Carbon abatement beneﬁt from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account.
Total energy use is normalised to reﬂect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.
Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.
Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated
teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.
Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 30 countries, based on seating class and distance ﬂown.
As we operate largely outside of the UK, all ﬂights domestic or international with ﬂight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department
for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) as domestic ﬂights have been classiﬁed as short haul. All ﬂights with distance ﬂown ranging
from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classiﬁed as medium haul.
The Carbon Trust is our independent third-party assurance provider for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, our measured Scope 1 and
Scope 2 emissions were assured by the Carbon Trust, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.

Donating shares to ShareGift

Electronic communications

Shareholders who have a small number of shares often ﬁnd it
uneconomical to sell them. An alternative is to consider donating them
to the charity ShareGift (registered charity 1052686), which collects
donations of unwanted shares until there are enough to sell, and
uses the proceeds to support UK charities. There is no implication for
capital gains tax (no gain or loss) when you donate shares to charity,
and UK taxpayers may be able to claim income tax relief on the value
of their donation.

If you hold your shares on the UK register and in future you would like
to receive the Annual Report and Accounts electronically rather than
by post, please register online at: investorcentre.co.uk. Then click
on Register and follow the instructions. You will need to have your
Shareholder or ShareCare reference number when you log on. You
can ﬁnd this on your share certiﬁcate or ShareCare statement. Once
registered you can also submit your proxy vote and dividend election
electronically, and change your bank mandate or address information.

Further information can be obtained from

Forward-looking statements
This document may contain ‘forward-looking statements’ that are
based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as assumptions
about future events. These forward-looking statements can be
identiﬁed by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as ‘may’,
‘could’, ‘will’, ‘expect’, ‘intend’, ‘estimate’, ‘anticipate’, ‘believe’, ‘plan’,
‘seek’, ‘continue’ or other words of similar meaning. By their very
nature, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and
uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause
actual results, and the Group’s plans and objectives, to differ materially
from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Recipients should not place reliance on, and are cautioned about
relying on, any forward-looking statements. There are several factors
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. The factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those described
in the forward-looking statements include (but are not limited to)
changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive,
market and regulatory forces or conditions, future exchange and
interest rates, changes in tax rates, future business combinations or
dispositions and other factors speciﬁc to the Group. Any forwardlooking statement contained in this document is based on past or
current trends and/or activities of the Group and should not be
taken as a representation that such trends or activities will continue
in the future.
No statement in this document is intended to be a proﬁt forecast or to
imply that the earnings of the Group for the current year or future years
will necessarily match or exceed the historical or published earnings
of the Group. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the
date of the particular statement. Except as required by any applicable
laws or regulations, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation to
revise or update any forward looking statement contained within this
document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as
a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Nothing in this document shall constitute, in any jurisdiction, an offer
or solicitation to sell or purchase any securities or other ﬁnancial

June 2011. In December 2017, the BCBS
published a document setting out the
ﬁnalisation of the Basel III framework.
The latest requirements issued in December
2017 will be implemented from 2022.

CRD IV or Capital Requirements
Directive IV
A capital adequacy legislative package
adopted by EU member states. CRD IV

are due in accordance with the contractual
terms of the instrument and the cash ﬂows
that the Group expects to receive over the
contractual life of the instrument.
Clawback
An amount an individual is required to pay
back to the Group, which has to be returned
to the Group under certain circumstances.
CRE or Commercial real estate
Includes ofﬁce buildings, industrial property,
medical centres, hotels, malls, retail stores,
shopping centres, farm land, multi-family
housing buildings, warehouses, garages,

Represents the proportion of total operating
expenses to total operating income.
Underlying CIR represents the proportion of
total underlying expenses to total underlying
operating income.
Countercyclical capital buffer
The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is
part of a set of macroprudential instruments,
designed to help counter procyclicality in the
ﬁnancial system. CCyB as deﬁned in the
Basel III standard provides for an additional
capital requirement of up to 2.5 per cent of
risk-weighted assets in a given jurisdiction.
The Bank of England’s Financial Policy
Committee has the power to set the CCyB
rate for the United Kingdom. Each bank must
calculate its ‘institution-speciﬁc’ CCyB rate,

certiﬁcates of indebtedness of the Group
to the bearer of the certiﬁcate. These are
liabilities of the Group and include certiﬁcates
of deposits.
DTA or Deferred tax asset
Income taxes recoverable in future periods in
respect of deductible temporary differences
between the accounting and tax base of
an asset or liability that will result in tax
deductible amounts in future periods, the
carry-forward of tax losses or the carryforward of unused tax credits.

respect of taxable temporary differences
between the accounting and tax base of
an asset or liability that will result in taxable
amounts in future periods.

payments required to settle the obligations
of a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme resulting from
employee service.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme

Delinquency
A debt or other ﬁnancial obligation is
considered to be in a state of delinquency
when payments are overdue. Loans and
advances are considered to be delinquent
when consecutive payments are missed.
Also known as arrears.

Dividend per share
Represents the entitlement of each
shareholder in the share of the proﬁts of the
Company. Calculated in the lowest unit of
currency in which the shares are quoted.
Early alert, purely and non-purely
precautionary
A borrower’s account which exhibits risks or
potential weaknesses of a material nature
requiring closer monitoring, supervision, or
attention by management. Weaknesses
in such a borrower’s account, if left
uncorrected, could result in deterioration of
repayment prospects and the likelihood of
being downgraded to credit grade 12 or
worse. When an account is on early alert,
it is classiﬁed as either purely precautionary
or non-purely precautionary. A purely
precautionary account is one that exhibits
early alert characteristics but these do not
present any imminent credit concern. If the
symptoms present an imminent credit
concern, an account will be considered for
classiﬁcation as non-purely precautionary.
Effective tax rate

EAD or Exposure at default
The estimation of the extent to which the
Group may be exposed to a customer or
counterparty in the event of, and at the time
of, that counterparty’s default. At default,
the customer may not have drawn the loan
fully or may already have repaid some of the
principal, so that exposure is typically less
than the approved loan limit.

Forborne – not impaired loans
Loans where the contractual terms have
been modiﬁed due to ﬁnancial difﬁculties of
the borrower, but the loan is not considered
to be impaired. See ‘Forbearance’.

G-SIBs or Global Systemically
Important Banks
Global banking ﬁnancial institutions
whose size, complexity and systemic
interconnectedness mean that their distress
or failure would cause signiﬁcant disruption
to the wider ﬁnancial system and economic
activity. The list of G-SIBs is assessed under

BCBS. In the EU, the G-SIB framework is
implemented via CRD IV and G-SIBs are
referred to as Global Systemically Important
Institutions (G-SIIs).
G-SIB buffer
A CET1 capital buffer which results from
designation as a G-SIB. The G-SIB buffer
is between 1 per cent and 3.5 per cent,
depending on the allocation to one of ﬁve
buckets based on the annual scoring.
The G-SIB buffer has been phased in by
1 January 2019. In the EU, the G-SIB buffer
is implemented via CRD IV as Global

supports the IASB in providing authoritative
guidance on the accounting treatment of
issues not speciﬁcally dealt with by existing
IFRSs and IASs.
Investment grade
A debt security, treasury bill or similar
instrument with a credit rating measured
by external agencies of AAA to BBB.
Leverage ratio
A ratio that compares Tier 1 capital to total
exposures, including certain exposures held
off-balance sheet as adjusted by stipulated
credit conversion factors. Intended to be a
simple, non-risk-based backstop measure.
Liquid asset ratio
Ratio of total liquid assets to total assets.
Liquid assets comprise cash (less restricted
balances), net interbank, treasury bills and
debt securities less illiquid securities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Forbearance
Forbearance takes place when a concession
is made to the contractual terms of a loan in
response to an obligor’s ﬁnancial difﬁculties.
The Group classiﬁes such modiﬁed loans as
either ‘Forborne – not impaired loans’ or
‘Loans subject to forbearance – impaired’.
Once a loan is categorised as either of these,

Loans to banks
Amounts loaned to credit institutions
including securities bought under
Reverse repo.
LTV or loan-to-value ratio
A calculation which expresses the amount

own funds and eligible liabilities
A requirement under the Bank Recovery
and Resolution Directive for EU resolution
authorities to set a minimum requirement for
own funds and eligible liabilities for banks,
implementing the FSB’s Total Loss Absorbing
Capacity (TLAC) standard. MREL is intended
to ensure that there is sufﬁcient equity and
speciﬁc types of liabilities to facilitate an
orderly resolution that minimises any impact
on ﬁnancial stability and ensures the
continuity of critical functions and avoids
exposing taxpayers to loss.
Net asset value (NAV) per share
Ratio of net assets (total assets less total
liabilities) to the number of ordinary shares

renegotiation, and against which no loss of
principal is expected.
Non-linearity
Non-linearity of expected credit loss occurs
when the average of expected credit loss
for a portfolio is higher than the base case
(median) due to the fact that bad economic
environment could have a larger impact
on ECL calculation than good economic
environment.
Normalised items
See ‘Underlying earnings’.
Operating expenses
Staff and premises costs, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation
and amortisation. Underlying operating
expenses exclude expenses as described
in ‘Underlying earnings’. A reconciliation
between underlying and statutory
earnings is contained in Note 2 to the

difference between fair value and prudent
value positions, where the application of
prudence results in a lower absolute
carrying value than recognised in the
ﬁnancial statements.

Residential mortgage
A loan to purchase a residential property
which is then used as collateral to guarantee
repayment of the loan. The borrower gives
the lender a lien against the property, and the
lender can foreclose on the property if the
borrower does not repay the loan per the
agreed terms. Also known as a home loan.
RoE or Return on equity

RWA or Risk-weighted assets
A measure of a bank’s assets adjusted
for their associated risks, expressed
as a percentage of an exposure value
in accordance with the applicable
standardised or IRB approach provisions.

Secured (fully and partially)
A secured loan is a loan in which the
borrower pledges an asset as collateral for
a loan which, in the event that the borrower
defaults, the Group is able to take possession
of. All secured loans are considered fully
secured if the fair value of the collateral is
equal to or greater than the loan at the time
of origination. All other secured loans are
considered to be partly secured.
Securitisation
Securitisation is a process by which credit
exposures are aggregated into a pool,
which is used to back new securities.
Under traditional securitisation transactions,
assets are sold to a structured entity (SE)
which then issues new securities to investors
at different levels of seniority (credit tranching).
This allows the credit quality of the assets to
be separated from the credit rating of the
originating institution and transfers risk to
external investors in a way that meets their
risk appetite. Under synthetic securitisation
transactions, the transfer of risk is achieved
by the use of credit derivatives or guarantees,
and the exposures being securitised remain
exposures of the originating institution.
Senior debt
Debt that takes priority over other unsecured
or otherwise more ‘junior’ debt owed by the
issuer. Senior debt has greater seniority in the
issuer’s capital structure after subordinated
debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt,
senior debt theoretically must be repaid
before other creditors receive any payment.
SICR or Signiﬁcant increase in
credit risk
Assessed by comparing the risk of default of
an exposure at the reporting date to the risk
of default at origination (after considering the
passage of time).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Probability weighted
Obtained by considering the values the
metric can assume, weighted by the
probability of each value occurring.

Roll rate
Uses a matrix that gives average loan
migration rate from delinquency states from
period to period. A matrix multiplication is
then performed to generate the ﬁnal PDs
by delinquency bucket over different
time horizons.

Equity securities in operating companies
generally not quoted on a public exchange.
Investment in private equity often involves the
investment of capital in private companies.
Capital for private equity investment is
raised by retail or institutional investors and
used to fund investment strategies such
as leveraged buyouts, venture capital,
growth capital, distressed investments
and mezzanine capital.

Repo/reverse repo
A repurchase agreement or repo is a
short-term funding agreement, which allows
a borrower to sell a ﬁnancial asset, such
as asset backed securities or government
bonds as collateral for cash. As part of
the agreement the borrower agrees to
repurchase the security at some later date,
usually less than 30 days, repaying the
proceeds of the loan. For the party on the
other end of the transaction (buying the
security and agreeing to sell in the future),
it is a reverse repurchase agreement or
reverse repo.
