The serious damage to our ecosystems, the defacement of our beautiful planet, the plundering and annihilation of
so many amazing creatures that inhabit our world is shocking.
It needs to stop.
The illegal trade in the sale of wild animals either as pets, or for their hides, tusks or other parts for use in food,
medicine, exotic leathers, jewellery and ornaments is worth US$ 20 billion every year. The increase in illegal
poaching worldwide is a worrying trend.
Today, there are 7,000 endangered species in the world, and many are nearing extinction. We all have a role to
play in protecting the planet, and the actions we take today as individuals, communities, corporates and countries
will determine their future for generations to come.
So, what’s being done?
The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) is leading the industry’s effort to fight this challenge. The
Buenos Aires Declaration is a commitment to reach one billion travellers with our messages and to work with
communities to develop sustainable tourism that provides livelihoods and protects wildlife. WTTC and the
World Wildlife Fund are developing guidelines to eliminate illegal wildlife trafficking from our supply chains.
United for Wildlife, spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge and the Royal Foundation, is implementing projects
to end the entire illegal wildlife trade chain. It believes combining forces with the private sector is crucial in
stopping the trafficking of wildlife products. The Buckingham Palace Declaration, signed in March 2016, commits
to taking steps to shut down the routes exploited by illegal wildlife traffickers and remove the vulnerabilities in
transportation and customs to tackle the criminals.
As one of the world’s largest businesses in the aviation industry, the Emirates Group is committed to making a
positive difference in combatting illegal wildlife trade, and to marshalling our resources in support of this cause.

From an early stage, the UAE’s growth journey was guided by a human-centred development model
with a primary aim to serve the people and ensure their happiness. In this vision for development, our
ambitions were not limited to matching the progress of the world’s most developed countries. We set
our sights on being a frontrunner on the global stage, a leader in shaping the future of humanity.
The aviation, travel, tourism and leisure industries have always been a key part of this vision. They
represent important pillars of our national economy and are vital to our global aspirations. These sectors
are also at the heart of our efforts to be a global commercial hub and a lifestyle destination. The Emirates
Group was one of the major initiatives we launched in our pursuit of excellence in these sectors.
Today, the Group is a market leader and industry trendsetter. It is an achievement we can all be
proud of. We can never underestimate the role that Emirates has played in various dimensions of
our development.

The Arabian Oryx was reintroduced into the Dubai Desert
Conservation Reserve and now forms one of the largest,
free roaming herds of its kind in the region. It was the
first animal to be reclassified - from extinct in the wild to
vulnerable - by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Emirates has helped us tap the power of our strategic
geographic location. It has also been instrumental in the
city’s rapid rise as a tourism hub. Dubai was ranked the
world’s fourth most visited city for the fourth year in a
row by the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index
(GDCI) 2018. Dubai also topped the list of global cities
with the highest international overnight visitor spend for
the third year in a row.
Parallel to Emirates’ rise as a world-leading airline, we
were able to create high-quality infrastructure, some of
the world’s best hotels and hospitality service levels that
are unrivalled globally. We have shown the world that we
never rest on our achievements.
Dubai has set itself an ambitious target of welcoming
25 million visitors by 2025. Next year, we will be
welcoming millions of guests to Expo 2020, the largest
event to be ever organised in the Arab world. It will be an

opportunity to showcase our finest hospitality,
organisational capabilities, infrastructure, and investment
opportunities. Expo will be a catalyst, not only for ideas
and innovation, but also connectivity and growth across
the world.
Our development journey today is marked by two key
themes – ambition and sustainability. In 2022, we are set
to be the first Arab country to have conducted a mission
to Mars. As part of our longer-term space aspirations,
we plan to establish the first-ever inhabitable human
settlement on Mars by 2117. We are at the global
forefront of harnessing a range of other advanced
technologies, including artificial intelligence and Internet
of Things. Dubai's and the UAE’s success has
essentially been a story of partnerships between the
government and citizens, and between the public and
private sectors. Investors, entrepreneurs, scientists,
creative professionals and innovators from all over

the world have come together here to achieve their
dreams. Our spirit of peaceful coexistence goes
hand in hand with our ethos of collaboration and
partnership. We have opened our doors for everyone
seeking opportunities to contribute their talent and
innovation. That is why it has become a preferred
destination for people across the world, whether it
be for investment, work or lifestyle. More than 200
nationalities live in Dubai in harmony, making the city
a model for cultural coexistence.
The Emirates Group continues to be one of the key
enablers of our unique role in the world – a bridge
between markets, cultures and regions. In the years
ahead, I believe it will be an even bigger player in
the UAE’s economic march and further enhance its
leadership in shaping the future of the world’s
aviation, travel, tourism and leisure industries.

the aviation industry. While global passenger traffic was up through the year, it was
buffeted by shifting economic realities and geopolitics.
Demand for air cargo faced significant headwinds and, according to IATA, global
economic activity and consumer confidence weakened by March this year. The
Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicated falling global export orders since
September 2018. Political posturing and slow progress on pressing global issues,
including several ongoing trade wars, Brexit and the refugee crisis, conspired to bog
down the global economic outlook even further.

Crude oil prices rose sharply in the first half of our
financial year, and then remained volatile. As a result, jet
fuel prices soared by 22% over our financial year. There
were significant currency fluctuations in India, Iran
and Brazil, and volatility and devaluations in Africa and
South America.
Although passenger traffic in the Middle East jumped
by 4.2% in 2018, it was down from the 6.9% growth
in 2017, marking the second consecutive year of
tempering demand growth. IATA believes this growth
deceleration reflects the impact of policy measures and
geopolitical tensions.
Competition in the aviation industry was stiff globally,
and more so regionally. Our regional competitors
constantly snapped at our heels, with a one-point
business plan to always undercut Emirates’ fares at all
costs. Unlike some, we must operate on a commercial
basis. We took a broad and fresh approach to our
traditional pricing strategies to avoid engaging in price

wars and to improve yield, even if it meant conceding
market share. This allowed us to continue
to invest in product and service excellence.
Both Emirates and dnata managed to ride these
challenging waves, thanks to two key factors: our
hub, centrally located on the map, is a global and
regional powerhouse; and our clear focus on our
long-term strategy.
Globally, major airlines strengthened their networks,
bought longer range aircraft to bypass hubs, enhanced
their inflight product and created better airport
experiences. Our response was to up our own game.
The Group invested AED 14.6 billion in new aircraft,
equipment, acquisitions, facilities, state-of-the-art
technologies, and employee initiatives. We enjoyed our
31st consecutive year of profit, earned record revenues
and maintained a robust cash balance.

We declared a dividend of AED 500 million to the Investment
Corporation of Dubai. Through the year, the airline focussed
on delivering what the customer has come to expect from
us: the unexpected. We invested in the latest aircraft, pinned
more destinations on our route network, created more
connections through partnerships, and delivered even better
experiences on the ground and on board.
At dnata, we continued without breaking stride, acquiring
new businesses, expanding our network globally,
investing in people, equipment and safety, and
consolidating our operations.
We tightened our cost discipline. Across the Group, we
streamlined our support services operations with new
technology, systems and processes. While Emirates’ overall
employee count declined and productivity improved,
dnata’s workforce increased by 10% to 45,000, mainly due
to acquisitions. Our total workforce grew by 2% to 105,286
employees, across our business, including our
120+ subsidiaries.

Both Emirates and dnata meticulously prepared for the
southern runway rehabilitation at Dubai International
airport (DXB) in April and May 2019. No question – this
is going to hit us hard, and we expect it to impact our
financial results next year.
The UAE’s 47th National Day on 2 December was a proud
occasion for all of us at the Group and for everyone in
the country as Emirates, Etihad, flydubai, Air Arabia and
Al Fursan took to the skies in unison to celebrate the
day and commemorate the legacy of the nation’s late
founding father HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
It showcased the UAE’s aviation success story to the
nation and the world.
We are marking the countdown to Expo 2020 Dubai by
gearing up to attract 25 million visits and by building a
show stopping pavilion. Our 40 aircraft in the Expo 2020
livery fly across the six continents on our network, upping

edition collection of Expo 2020 themed A380 and 777

aircraft models, and a series of podcasts and films
inflight to educate our customers about the six-month
event of global entertainment, inspiration and
unique experiences.
Emirates and Dubai Future Accelerators launched a sixth

on the challenges put forth by the airline. We also
support and partner with Intelak, the first aviation, travel

has boosted the country’s innovation ecosystem by
encouraging a number of young entrepreneurs to come
together and transform their ideas into reality.
Sustainability and the future of the planet are global
issues close to our hearts, and we are acutely conscious
of our position to influence stakeholders and champion
advocacy. Our leadership team, our employees and our
brands are spearheading several initiatives internally and
with global partners to make an enduring difference.

The Emirates Group remains committed to Dubai,
our customers, employees and stakeholders. Our
ongoing investments in our people, technology, and
infrastructure will help us sharpen our competitive
edge, ensure we are ready for opportunities, and stay
on course for sustainable growth.

Despite cutthroat competition, our revenue increased by 6%. However, fuel and
currency volatility, as well as global trading conditions, conspired to reduce our
profitability and our profit margin significantly.
Our total operating costs increased mainly due to the sharp 22% upswing in jet fuel
prices, on top of last year’s 15% surge. Fuel now forms 32% of our operating costs, and
remains our biggest expense. We were also negatively impacted by the strengthening
of the US Dollar to the tune of AED 572 million, a swing of
AED 1.2 billion from the previous year.
Emirates SkyCargo bucked the trend and did us proud with a strong performance in
a highly competitive market with weak demand. The division contributed 14% of the
airline’s total transport revenue and played a role in expanding our network.

Last year, we got smarter, more connected, and far
more inventive, both operationally and commercially.
We rationalised our routes further, and took a more
dynamic approach to deploying capacity to take the
best advantage of global seasonality in demand.
This optimised our fleet and network as we adjusted
frequencies during peak travel periods. Our dynamic
scheduling has been made possible by integrating
smarter operational intelligence with customer insights,
and close ties with airports and other partners.
The drive to revolutionise air travel and always be better
is hardwired into our DNA, and it enables us to deliver
unforgettable experiences at every touchpoint, every
time. In October, we introduced our bold new brand
promise Fly Better to the world, through a series of
marketing activities, including inspiring TV commercials
and our global sports sponsorship branding. We
reaffirmed our customers’ conviction that they can
expect product and service superiority - from the
moment they browse to book with us to the time they
say their lingering goodbyes.

Our Emirates-flydubai partnership has created
significant synergies by reducing route overlaps and
realigning schedules to common destinations. Customers
benefitted from greater global connectivity, schedule
flexibility, an integrated loyalty programme, and the
convenience of travelling on a single ticket with seamless
baggage handling.
In 2018-19, the two airlines jointly carried 3.4 million
customers on codeshare flights across 84 destinations.
This year, we will expand our codeshare network further.
Over 175,000 Emirates Skywards members have flown and
earned more than 550 million Skywards Miles on flydubai.

A330neos and A350s gives us the required flexibility.
In 2019-20, we plan to receive six A380s and retire eight
Boeing 777s, keeping our fleet strong and young. Our next
stop will be Porto in Portugal, where we will offer four weekly
services from 2 July.
Our employee numbers declined by 3% to 60,282, due to
natural attrition, reduced recruitment, and smarter ways of
working that led to productivity gains. Productivity remained
high at AED 2 million revenue earned per airline employee,
an 11% increase from the previous year. Proud, committed
employees – from our award-winning crew, lounge, checkin and contact centre agents to all our specialists and
professionals who work behind the scenes – were unified by
our brand promise to create memorable travel experiences
and ensure our customers fly better with us every day.
As a business with a big conscience, we don’t just want our
customers to fly better, we also want to do better for the
planet and be good corporate citizens. Our close partnership
with United for Wildlife; our long-standing conservation
efforts at Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve and the
Emirates One&Only Wolgan Valley; and our extensive work
with underprivileged children globally through the Emirates
Airline Foundation are our sincere efforts to give back to the
community, and leave a lasting legacy for future generations.

We are strong believers in the A380 programme, despite
Airbus’ decision to stop production in 2021. Our current and
future investments in the iconic Emirates A380, including
the introduction of Premium Economy in 2020, will continue
to wow our customers.

At Emirates, we’re passionate about soaring higher,
flying better.

We have been reviewing our fleet mix options for some

In February, we ordered 40 A330neos and 30 A350-900s worth US$ 21.4 billion at list
prices in an agreement signed with Airbus, to be delivered from 2021 and 2024. We will
receive 14 more A380s from 2019 until the end of 2021, taking our total A380 fleet to
123 aircraft.
In 2018-19, we received 13 new aircraft – seven A380s and six Boeing 777-300ERs – and
retired 11 older aircraft, bringing our fleet count to 270 on 31 March 2019. The fleet
roll-over involving 24 aircraft was again one of the largest managed in a year, keeping
our average fleet age at a youthful 6.1 years.

YEARS

We hit two fleet milestones in 2018-19: we celebrated 10 years of A380 operations last
August, and took delivery of our last Boeing 777-300ER on our order book. This makes it
our 146th 777-300ER and the 190th 777 aircraft delivered to us. It means one out of every
eight 777 aircraft ever manufactured by Boeing has been delivered to us.

We remain the world’s largest operator of both the
A380 and the 777 aircraft, and also the only airline in
the world to have operated all the six variants of the
777 family. Our A380s continue to command awe and
stir excitement. We support governments and airports
with one-off services, and in 2018-19, we flew to five
cities: Beirut, Muscat, Islamabad, Riyadh and Accra, and
included temporary services to St Petersburg.
Our teams are busy finalising the next generation
bespoke cabin designs of our Boeing 777Xs and the
Premium Economy on our A380s, which is scheduled for
delivery from 2020.
Keeping our fleet airworthy and in mint condition is
the job of our dedicated team of engineers. Last year,
the team successfully accomplished the first complete
replacement of the entire landing gear on one of our
A380s. Our engineers converted 10 of our 777-200LRs
from a three- to a two-class configuration by investing
16,000 man-hours and sourcing 2,700 spare parts from
30 suppliers.
Our engineering team also launched four important
projects: iShare, in collaboration with Airbus, e-logbooks,
Safety Equipment RFID tracking and the Hub Monitor,
all of which give us excellent real-time visibility in
tracking and early identification of potential disruptors
for timely resolution.

Supporting economies
We help create markets for growing economies. In Vietnam, for example, we worked closely with Vietrade,
and as a result, the export volume of fruits like rambutans and lychees has increased fivefold. Perishable
exports from Vietnam to Dubai touched a record 1,433 tonnes by end-March.
We support agricultural economies with our expertise in handling perishables, end-to-end cool-chain
facilities, and flexible freighter operations. We work with millions of farmers, growers and horticulturists to
explore international markets and auctions for their produce. Our daily freighter service from Nairobi, for
example, carries freshly harvested roses and flowers to Amsterdam, the world’s largest flower distribution
centre, helping support thousands of people who depend on the floriculture industry.

our people, our sponsorships, our work with partners
to progress the aviation industry, and our participation
in world events like World Environment Day and
International Women’s Day.

So, as the next 12 months roll out, we will keep on
investing wisely in people and technology, and assessing
our processes, our agility and our structure to ensure
we are running the business the right way – being fully
aware that the concept of ‘the right way’ may look very
different year on year. Despite the challenges, we were
still able to grow our revenue by 10% and our cash
balance by 4%. We invested AED 700 million back into
the business, particularly in Australia, Canada, Ireland,
Pakistan, Switzerland, the UAE, the UK and the US.
We looked at where we need to restructure to grab
opportunities and respond to industry challenges, and in
Asia Pacific we now have a regional CEO who oversees
operations at 10 airports in Australia, the Philippines and
Singapore, managing a total workforce of 6,000 people.

to establish ground handling and catering operations
there. We invested in equipment, created 50 new jobs
and today serve five flights per day in Nashville, our
14th US location.
The bedrock of our growth strategy is making smart
and organic acquisitions. We are not aiming for global
domination, or creating the world’s largest air services
network – we look for opportunities with businesses
that are aligned to our values, have strong management
teams, good track records on safety and standards, and
are willing to work the dnata way. This year we invested
more than AED 600 million alone in smart and strategic
acquisitions in Australia, Germany, Italy, the US, and
the UAE.

Sustainability, because the future of the industry, and indeed
the world, depends on it. We are making great progress on
minimising waste, cutting out single use plastic and reducing
energy and water consumption across our facilities. We have
also just signed a MoU with the University of Pretoria to
support wildlife research and rescue, under the umbrella of our
corporate responsibility programme, dnata4good.
We have finished the year in a good position – proud of our
growth and achievements, yet armed with a practical to-do list
that will keep us on our path of ongoing improvement. Across
our employee ranks, we are fortunate to work with people who
are passionate about aviation, safety conscious, innovative
and service oriented and together, we are looking forward to
another great 12 months.

Our consistency in delivering world-class safety and
service last year helped us win more than 100 key
contracts across our business. It has also cemented our
relationships with our current customers and partners
– a factor that has in turn led to significant business
growth. For example, when British Airways planned

Safety and sustainability will remain our top priorities

Safety is a fundamental, uncompromising tenet of our business globally, and one of

technology and leadership communications.
We launched our Stop observation programme with a clear message: if you see
something, say something. It was designed with simplicity and ease in mind, and proved
so successful that we are set to launch a mobile app later in the year. A safety stand down
day for forklift activities across our network raised awareness following an incident, and
achieved a significant reduction in forklift incidents. Our leadership team raised their
visibility at safety tours globally.

Our culture surveys continued to be rolled out across

scheduled to do so this year.

We introduced common Safety Performance Indicators,

coupled with the identification of top 10 risks across
our businesses, helped us to prioritise our investments
in safety.

We have set action plans in all locations that have

means that our people are not punished for mistakes
they make as a result of lack of experience or training,

intentional violations of safety procedures or company
policies, or destructive actions.

It was a journey of cultural discovery for us
worldwide. We took a broad look at the way we do

everything we do. Some key aspects where we
exceeded expectations were: we celebrate our people

We acquired a majority stake in DUBZ, a baggage technology and logistics company
that emerged from Dubai’s incubator programme Intelak. Arriving passengers at DXB’s
terminals 1 and 2 can get their baggage delivered, and those departing can check-in
their baggage and receive boarding passes anywhere in the city. It makes travel

Freightworks LLC and a 51% majority stakeholder of
Bolloré Logistics LLC, UAE that operates in 106 countries.
Last year, we focused on realigning our business to
address customer demands, both above and below the
wing. We launched a hotline for customer feedback
and issues management, manned by a team that works
collaboratively with key airport stakeholders. Using Net

process and service, ensuring a seamless experience at
delivery bays. One Cargo connects our global operations
on a single technology platform.
We automated our appointment and dock management
to unify our engagement with freight forwarders. We
have also trialled drones in the warehouse to identify and
monitor shipments with 100% accuracy.
Choosing green or hybrid options is a prime
consideration in all our Ground Support Equipment (GSE)

to refurbish our GSE fleet to extend their life-cycles,
reduce waste and update them to the latest safety and

Industry certifications underline corporate compliance

pharma handling services globally was recognised with
IATA’s CIEV* Pharma certification in Dubai and Toronto,
and GDP** certification in London and Zurich.

We received ISAGO*** Station Accreditations at Manila, Cebu

With such massive production schedules, consistency
is key to maintaining world-class quality standards

Emirates is committed to using its global brand power to uphold world agreements,
be vigilant during cargo acceptance, and to raise awareness and direct funds into
conservation. We have zero tolerance on carrying banned species, hunting trophies or
any products associated with illegal wildlife activities.
Our ground handling colleagues are trained in IATA’s Live Animal Regulations and our
internal policies on carrying wildlife. Our frontline employees are trained to recognise
and report suspicious cargo. We have established a dedicated reporting channel
to empower our people and partners to stop illegal trade by flagging confidential
information that can protect endangered species. We have rolled out poster
campaigns across the organisation to create awareness.

As a leader in the aviation and travel industries, the Emirates Group recognises
that environmental responsibility is core to our long-term business success.
We are committed to minimising the environmental impact of our operations
across all our businesses and activities, including our supply chain. Our
environmental policy articulates this positioning for all employees and
stakeholders across the Group.
Though we have a significant and positive impact on economies globally, our
fuel consumption has an environmental impact. We minimise that impact by
investing in a multi-billion dollar fleet that is one of the youngest in the skies
and sports state-of-the-art technology, reducing fuel use, noise and emissions.
Working with air traffic management providers, aviation authorities and airports,
we establish fuel-saving routes and flight procedures.

ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION

Last year, we created a permanent Operations Efficiency
Steering Group that set stakeholder targets and
implemented several initiatives, including the monitoring,
reporting and verification of fuel-saving initiatives. We
leveraged data and analytics to optimise fuel quantities
on every flight.
From 1 September to 31 March, we reduced our fuel
consumption by 26,000 tonnes, which in turn reduced
carbon emissions by 82,200 tonnes and saved costs
worth around AED 68 million.
We support the introduction of the Carbon Offsetting
and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
(CORSIA) through the International Civil Aviation

Organization (ICAO) and have been monitoring our
carbon emissions since January. From 2020, we will
begin reporting these to the UAE authorities.
We encourage, and are eagerly awaiting, the
development of a viable supply chain for sustainable
aviation fuel. Our flight crew reduce noise by flying
noise abatement routes, where practical. We switch
off aircraft auxiliary power units where ground power
and pre-conditioned air are available. Our teams
have installed equipment to increase energy and
water efficiency in our facilities. Emirates Engineering
uses dry washing techniques to clean aircraft and
have installed solar arrays to generate electricity in
our facilities.

Emirates Flight Catering and US-based Crop One
Holdings, an industry leader, are co-investing
US$ 40 million to build the world’s largest vertical
farming facility near DWC. When complete, it will
cover 130,000 sq.ft, but with production matching
900 acres of farmland.
The facility will have the capacity to harvest
2,700 kg of high-quality, herbicide- and pesticidefree leafy greens daily, using 99% less water than
outdoor fields. The first products are expected to
be delivered to Emirates Flight Catering’s customers
from December 2019.

To promote the use of indigenous vegetation in
landscaping, we plant ghafs, the UAE’s national tree
that is perfectly adapted to desert conditions, in
the sites and facilities managed by us. We refurbish
and repurpose equipment to reduce waste and we
recycle from our offices and operational facilities. We
are designing solutions to reduce single-use plastic
items and other waste onboard, and are using more
sustainable products such as our ecoThread™ blankets,
which are made from recycled plastic bottles.
In dnata, we developed a set of environmental
standards, covering key aspects of our operations
including waste management, energy efficiency, water
and wastewater management. These standards form
part of the dnata Integrated Management System.
dnata Cargo launched a project to reuse polythene
sheeting in operations as part of the Lean Six
Sigma Green Belt programme, which resulted in a

significant reduction in resource consumption, cost
and landfill waste.

on-site treatment systems. Optimised production
processes are reducing waste per meal served.

Around one-third of all food grown in the world goes to
waste and landfills. dnata Catering’s core commitment
is to reduce that and carbon emissions, and develop
sustainable products and packaging. Bio-digesters at
our Brisbane, Canberra and Adelaide catering sites
have diverted more than 72 tonnes of food waste from
landfill since we installed them in July 2018. This has
prevented more than 300 tonnes of carbon emissions
and the disposal of 150 plastic bin liners every day. Our
UK-based En Route creates fibre-based food packaging
using waste materials from sugar processing.

In a number of operations, we support charities and
reduce our food waste through donations. For example,
in Australia, we donate around 1.5 tonnes of food every
month, which provides 6,000 meals for vulnerable
people. We have also designed an iPad app for our
kitchens to review airline menus. This has dramatically
reduced paper wastage and saves us around
AU$ 250,000 per year.

In Australia, we are reviewing food and beverages
coming off meal trays on inbound flights to identify
items that can be recovered – like unopened bottles
and pots of jam. Where liquid wastes have been
segregated on board, we dispose them through our

We recycle packaging materials and waste cooking
oil across our operations. Where energy recovery
from waste is an available option, like in our Dublin
operations, we opt for this over landfill disposal
of residual waste. We are enhancing our systems
for measuring, monitoring and tracking our waste
generation, and aim to set targets in the coming year.

Despite the unrelenting headwinds of
rising oil prices, unfavourable currency
movements in certain markets and
cutthroat competition; financial year
2018-19 marked our 31st consecutive
profitable year.
We continued with our strategic
imperative to operate a young, modern
and efficient fleet adding 7 Airbus 380s
and 6 Boeing 777-300ERs to our fleet
this year whilst phasing out 11 older
aircraft. We also substantially completed
revamping our 10 Boeing 777-200LR
aircraft with the new Business class
cabins, an initiative unveiled in March
2018. Although profits remained under
severe pressure during the financial
year, these investments, amongst others,
underscore our commitment to continue
inspiring travellers to fly better around
the world using our world-class product
and service offering.

Our fleet of Airbus 380 and Boeing
777 aircraft connects 158 destinations
across six continents through our hub

in Dubai, facilitating global travel and
trade. During the year we transported
58.6 million passengers and carried 2.7
million tonnes of cargo.
In February 2019, we announced an
order for 40 A330 Neos and 30 A350s.
These aircraft will complement Emirates’
fleet mix, support our network growth
and give us more flexibility to better
serve our seasonal demand.
With the launch of our new brand
promise “Fly Better”, we reaffirmed our
edge in providing air travel experiences
that are comfortable and enjoyable
in every cabin class. This year we also
inaugurated our 42nd dedicated lounge
in Cairo, Egypt.

revenue was propped up by better yields
which demonstrate our customers’
confidence in the premium product
and the services we offer. Volumes in
terms of RPKMs and tonnage carried
showed improvements of 2.7% and
1.4% respectively. This was due to an
increase in capacity, introduction of new
destinations and higher frequencies on
existing ones.

High fuel prices had a significant impact
on our operating profit of AED 2.6bn
(2017-18: AED 4.1bn) resulting in a
reduction in our operating margin to
2.7% (2017-18: 4.4%).
The reduction in profits meant the return
on shareholder’s funds declined to 2.4%
(2017-18: 7.9%).
Revenue

Hotel operations, including food
and beverage sales, did not perform
as expected due to difficult market
conditions and pushed non-transport
revenue down by 2.8%.

Our revenues crossed the AED 96bn
mark, showing an improvement of
5.3% over last year. Transport revenue
which comprises more than 95% of
Emirates’ revenue increased by 5.7% to
AED 92.1bn (2017-18: AED 87.1bn). The

Profitability
With external factors impeding our

traffic measured in RPKM increased
by 2.7% and the yield at AED 26.2
fils per RPKM (2017-18: AED 25.4 fils
per RPKM) improved by 3.1%. These
factors contributed to a 5.8% growth
in passenger revenue (including excess
baggage) to AED 79.0bn (2017-18: AED
74.7bn).
Our on-board hospitality moved even
higher as we refreshed our luxury
products helping the premium class seat
factor increase by 0.7%pt.
Along with organic growth, we
continued to forge partnerships to
expand our offering and benefit
customers. This year, Emirates entered

into new codeshare arrangement with
Jetstar Pacific and signed an MoU
with China Southern Airlines. We also
enhanced our agreement with South
African Airways. These new partnerships
provide increased destination choices to
our customers.
Our strategic partnership with flydubai
continued to grow stronger as this year
Emirates “Skywards” programme became
the loyalty programme for flydubai.
We introduced Home Check-in, our
initiative to help our passengers to
check-in with their luggage from
anywhere in Dubai. Our Skywards
team also introduced various initiatives
including ‘My Family’, a programme
which helps families to pool their miles
and enhance their award options.
Cargo revenue
SkyCargo contributed 14.2% (2017-18:
14.3%) of Emirates’ transport revenue,
continuing its success story.

Belly capacity increased further this
year with new aircraft and passenger
destinations. We also expanded our
freighter network to Bogota in Columbia
and relaunched Erbil in Iraq.
The current financial year also saw new
logistic arrangements with Alibaba
Group to deliver packages across
Emirates’ network as e-commerce
continues to drive growth in global air
cargo. We also launched new cargo
services such as Emirates AOG, for
priority transport of aircraft parts, and
Emirates Pets.
Annual cargo tonnage at 2,659 thousand
tonnes (2017-18: 2,623 thousand tonnes)
and cargo revenues at AED 13.1bn
(2017-18: AED 12.4bn), both crossed
record levels. FTKM increased by 2.3%
to 13.7bn (2017-18: 13.4bn) and the
yield per FTKM increased by 2.7% over
the previous year resulting from a better
cargo tariff mix.

Non-transport revenue
Our non-transport revenue includes
the sale of consumer goods, catering
operations, sale at F&B outlets and hotel
operations. The decrease in revenue this
year was largely due to loss of certain
customers in our catering business and
strong competition in the UAE hotel
market.
Revenue distribution
We continued to uphold the strategy of
maintaining a diversified revenue base as
the contribution from each geographical
region remained below 30% of the
total revenue with Europe being the
largest revenue contributor at 29.4%
(2017-18: 29.3%). All regions recorded
improvement in revenues this year
except the Gulf and Middle East which
continues to be afflicted by ongoing
political instability and softening of
passenger demand.

Operating costs
Operating costs, outpacing the growth
in revenues, rose by 8.0% to AED 95.3bn
(2017-18: AED 88.2bn). This increase was
primarily on account of fuel costs which
were up by 24.5% owing to escalated
fuel prices for most of the year.
Jet fuel cost
Jet fuel cost at 32% (2017-18: 28%)
continues to be the single largest
element of operating costs. The market
oil prices for jet fuel remained volatile
this year fluctuating between USD 71/
barrel to USD 95/barrel. The average
price this financial year was USD 84/per
barrel, which is an increase of 22% versus
last year. This, together with a higher fuel
uplift of 2.7% - in line with the growth
in capacity, resulted in our fuel bill rising
by 24.5% to AED 30.8bn (2017-18: AED
24.7bn).

Fuel costs per ATKM rose to 49 fils (201718: 41 fils).

Employee cost
Employee costs at AED 12.6bn (201718: AED 13.1bn) were down by 3.5%,
due to the drop in staff head count. Our
new and innovative ways of working,
introduced in previous years in certain
parts of the organisation where we felt
the need, have started yielding results.
Our productivity is up and we see a
gradual slowdown in the increase of
recurring employee cost.
Aircraft operating leases
Aircraft operating lease costs increased
by 2.3% to AED 12.0bn (2017-18: AED
11.7bn). This is due to the delivery of
one new aircraft on operating lease
during the year and full year impact of

10 aircraft delivered in the previous year.
These increases were partially offset by
the phase out of 11 (2017-18: 6) aircraft
on completion of their lease terms.
Direct operating costs
Direct operating costs including
handling, in-flight catering, landing
& parking and aircraft maintenance
increased by 4.0%, moving in parallel
with our capacity growth, offset by cost
savings in crew layover due to reduction
in staff strength and overflying, as a
result of better route planning.
Depreciation and amortisation
The increase of 5.3% or AED 487m
was primarily driven by 12 new aircraft
deliveries. The charge also increased
due to other capitalisations done during
the year, including; expansion of our

a new dedicated premium class in-flight
kitchen in the UAE through our catering
arm, Emirates Flight Catering.
Other operating costs
Sales and marketing costs decreased by
4.2% and stood at AED 6.1bn (2017-18:
AED 6.4bn) resulting from various cost
saving initiatives undertaken during the
year.
The foreign exchange loss of AED 333m
(2017-18: gain of AED 33m) aggravated
our cost base.
Unit cost
With the significant increase in jet fuel
prices, the total unit cost per ATKM
increased to 146 fils (2017-18: 139 fils)
per ATKM. Total unit cost per ATKM
excluding jet fuel showed a positive
movement and reduced to 97 fils (201718: 98 fils) per ATKM.

Capacity, traffic and
load factor
Capacity rose by 3.1% to 63.3bn ATKMs
(2017-18: 61.4bn) resulting from new
aircraft introduced to serve our evergrowing network. The overall traffic load
or RTKM growth was 2.6%.
Our passenger and cargo volumes
reached record levels as a result of
our service initiatives and enhanced
connectivity provided to our customers.
The overall load factor was 66.8%
(2017-18: 67.2%), while the break-even
load factor increased to 66.4% (2017-18:
65.2%) owing to higher unit costs per
ATKM mainly influenced by fuel.
2018-19 saw us achieving significant
milestones as we completed our 10th
year of the flagship A380 service
flying more than 105m passengers. In
December 2018, we also welcomed our
last Boeing 777-300ER into our fleet.
We continue to maintain our position

We remain the world’s largest Boeing 777
operator and it accounts for almost 59%
(2017-18: 59%) of the airline’s capacity,
carrying 59% (2017-18: 59%) of our
passengers and 76% (2017-18: 75%) of
our cargo tonnage.

as the largest operator of A380 aircraft
and with the addition of 7 new aircraft,
we now have 109 super-jumbos in our
fleet. The high seat factor on the A380
fleet continues to demonstrate the
customer preference for this aircraft.
This fleet carried 41% (2017-18: 41%) of
our passengers in 2018-19. With A380s
operating to 50 destinations, 32% (201718: 31%) of all cities across the Emirates
network are served by an A380. This
aircraft will remain the cornerstone of our
fleet mix and product offering well into
the 2030s.

The increase in aircraft departures,
passenger numbers and RPKMs was
driven by:

• New A380 services to Osaka and
Hamburg;
• Relaunched services to Istanbul’s
second airport – Sabiha Gokcen;

• Introduction of new passenger
services to three destinations –
Stansted, our third London airport
and 10th daily service to the city,
Edinburgh in Scotland and Santiago
in Chile, along with the full year
operations of destinations added
in the prior year in the Far East and
Europe;

The Boeing 777 aircraft continues
to remain an important pillar of our
operations. We added 6 aircraft to the
fleet and phased out 11, which brings the
total count of aircraft to 161.

• A new daily service from our hub in
Dubai to Auckland via Bali, the only
year-round non-stop flight between
Bali and Auckland;

Aircraft fleet and financing
Emirates reinforced its position as the
world’s largest all wide-body aircraft
operator by taking delivery of 13 Airbus
380 and Boeing 777 aircraft during the
financial year.
We are proud of our young fleet and
the combination of new deliveries and
phase-outs of old aircraft enabled us to
retain a youthful fleet age of 73 months
(2017-18: 68 months), substantially lower
than the industry average.
Continuing on our growth vision, we
intend to acquire 40 A330s and 30 A350s
along with 150 Boeing 777Xs and 14
A380s.
With 6 Boeing 777-300ER deliveries in
the year and the simultaneous phase-out
of 11 older Boeing 777 aircraft, Emirates
maintained its position as the world’s

largest Boeing 777 operator with 161
Boeing 777 aircraft as of the close of
this financial year. Augmenting Emirates’
position as the largest A380 operator,
we took delivery of 7 aircraft thereby
bringing the total A380 fleet to 109.
Underpinned by our financial strength
and solid track record of business
performance, Emirates continued to
innovate and develop new financing
arrangements in close collaboration with
the financial community.
During the year, Emirates raised a total
of AED 14.2bn (2017-18: AED 18.7bn)
in aircraft financing (largely through a
combination of term loans, finance and
operating leases). Committed offers
are in hand to finance all 6 A380s to be
delivered in the forthcoming financial
year.

As Export Credit Agency (ECA) support
was reinstated for Airbus deliveries,
we devised an innovative finance lease
structure to combine the traditional
export lease debt with junior debt from
Korean investors to finance 2 A380
deliveries in the year.
Testament to the increasing depth of the
Japanese structured financing market
for Emirates, all 6 Boeing 777-300ER
aircraft delivered were financed via a
Japanese Operating Lease with a Call
Option (JOLCO) raising funding of more
than USD 1bn during the year. Emirates
has now raised over USD 7.6bn from the
Japanese structured financing market
since 2014.

Emirates funded 2 A380s delivered in the
financial year through a USD 600 million
corporate Sukuk issued in March 2018.
Emirates and its financing partners were
awarded Aviation 100 ‘Deal of the Year
for Innovation’ by the Airline Economics
magazine for successfully refinancing
and terming out a commercial bridge
facility (initially put in place due to
non-availability of ECA cover) of AED
3.8 bn (USD 1.0 bn) via a novel hybrid
finance lease structure for 5 A380 aircraft
delivered last year. By maintaining access
to an institutional investor and bank
market base from Korea, Germany, the
United Kingdom and the Middle East,
Emirates continued to use this structure
for a further 2 A380 aircraft delivered in
the current financial year.

Cash position
Cash assets
Cash assets including short term bank
deposits are at a robust AED 17.0bn
(2017-18: 20.4bn). Complemented by
committed offers to finance next year’s
deliveries, these are expected to be
sufficient to meet all obligations falling
due in the next financial year.
The cash assets to total revenue fell to
17% (2017-18: 22%) and is below the
target range of 25% +/- 5%. However,
this is temporary and is expected to
improve as repayments of financial
liabilities, primarily comprising of
amortising borrowings & lease
liabilities and trade & other payables,
are expected to be less onerous in the
financial year 2019-20 compared to the
current year.
Cash from operating activities

92

Cash generation from operating
activities of AED 10.5bn (2017-18: AED
14.1bn) fell by 25.5%. This was due

to lower profitability and a resulting
reduction in working capital, including
payout of profit share to staff for prior
year. These factors together, reduced the
operating cash margin to 10.8% (201718: 15.3%).

EBITDAR and debt service
Cash profit from operations (EBITDAR) at
AED 24.3bn (2017-18: AED 25.0bn) was
2.7% lower than last year but still the third
highest ever reported by Emirates. Debt
service payments of AED 20.9bn were

up by 10% year on year. The payments
shown in the table below (including those
of previous years) exclude refinancing of
certain borrowings and lease liabilities at
commercially better rates.
The related cash inflows and outflows
are reported at their gross values in the
consolidated statement of cash flows and
in the relevant notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
Debt service payments, excluding
operating leases, amounted to AED 8.9bn

(2017-18: AED 7.3bn). This increase of
21.9% or AED 1.6bn was due to higher
borrowings and lease liabilities, which was
primarily due to the bond issued at the
end of last year and 10 aircraft acquired
under finance lease this year.
EBITDAR after debt service payments was
AED 3.4bn and equated to 14 (2017-18:
16) months of payments. EBITDAR margin
at 24.8% (2017-18: 27.0%) for the year was
2.2%pts. lower than last year.

Debt
Emirates’ borrowings and lease liabilities
increased to AED 53.0bn, up by 3.8% or
AED 1.9bn compared to the previous
year (2017-18: AED 51.1bn). This was
driven by the delivery of 10 new aircraft
and accommodation units obtained
through finance lease structures offset
by the repayments of amortising bonds,
finance lease liabilities and term loans.
The non-current portion of borrowings
and lease liabilities amounted to AED
45.4bn (2017-18: 42.1bn) and represents
87% (2017-18: 86%) of the total noncurrent liabilities while the current
portion of AED 7.6bn (2017-18: AED
9.0bn) accounted for 20% (2017-18:
22%) of the total current liabilities.

Net debt to equity ratio
The ratio of borrowings and lease
liabilities to total equity increased
to 141% (2017-18: 138%) due to an
increase in debt.
The net debt including aircraft operating
leases to equity ratio dropped to 209.8%
(2017-18: 216.4%) due to impacts of
higher net debt, lower aircraft operating
lease commitments and increase in
equity.
Net debt to EBITDAR ratio
The net debt including aircraft operating
leases to EBITDAR ratio increased to
326.0% (2017-18: 321.0%), due to lower
EBITDAR (down by 2.7%).
Debt repayment profile
We aim to achieve a stable repayment
profile by obtaining debt with periodic
instalments as opposed to bullet

payments. This enables us to manage
debt servicing through our operating
cash flows and thus allowing the use of
surplus cash for investment purposes. As
at the balance sheet date, all of our debt
was amortising in nature.
Debt collateralisation
Of the total debt of AED 53.0bn, 86%
or AED 45.7bn (2017-18: AED 45.1bn)
is secured against property, plant and
equipment. The remaining debt of AED
7.3bn (2017-18: AED 6.0bn) is adequately
covered against the carrying value of
unencumbered assets (property, plant
and equipment) amounting to AED
29.8bn (2017-18: AED 27.1bn).

Interest rate risk
With our ongoing fleet expansion, we
continue to use natural hedges and
other prudent hedging solutions such
as swaps to manage our interest rate
exposures. We target a risk-managed
portfolio approach, whilst taking
advantage of market movements, with
long-term view of hedging around
half of our interest rate risk exposures.
Borrowings and lease liabilities (net of
cash) including the off balance sheet
aircraft on operating leases at 31 March
2019, comprise 65% on a fixed interest
rate basis with the balance of 35% on
floating interest rates.
At 31 March 2019, borrowings and lease
liabilities carried an effective interest rate
of 4.0% (2017-18: 3.2%) which increased
due to the hike in LIBOR.

The average workforce fell by 3.3% to
60,282.
The average number of employees
in the airline decreased by 1,932 or
3.9% to 47,808. Employee numbers
have fallen across the business driven
by a recruitment slowdown, natural
attrition arising from retirements and
resignations. New ways of working
driven by technology, better processes
and people management led to higher
productivity.
Overseas station employee numbers
declined by 3.2% to 5,695 (2017-18:
5,885).
On an average, workforce in the
subsidiary companies marginally
reduced compared to the prior year.
The airline’s employee productivity
related key performance indicators

• Revenue per airline employee has
improved to AED 1,975 thousand
(2017-18: AED 1,784 thousand), a
10.7% upside due to growing airline
revenues and a reduction in employee
numbers.
• Capacity per airline employee is up
7.3% at 1,325 thousand ATKM (201718: 1,235 thousand ATKM) due to a
3.1% increase in capacity and a 3.9%
reduction in airline employee count.
• The load carried per airline employee
improved to 885 thousand RTKM
(2017-18: 829 thousand RTKM), up by
6.8% due to a 2.6% upside on overall
load carried and a drop in airline
workforce.

dnata marked its 60th year of operations with
strong revenues, profits and cash reserves as
we marched ahead in our journey to become
the leading, most admired and globally
recognised air-services provider.
dnata’s growth story, over the last 10 years,
has been phenomenal with our presence now
in 37 countries leading to significant increases
in revenues and profits. The two-pronged
growth strategy of international acquisitions,
which add leverage to our core operations
and are aligned to our values, and organic
expansion continue to bring great results. A
diversified business model underpinned by
excellent customer service helped dnata add
one more successful chapter to its history.
All four core lines of business – international
airport operations, travel services, UAE
airport operations and inflight catering saw
sturdy growth in revenues. This year’s profits,
however, were augmented by one-off income
from the divestment of our 22% stake in Hogg
Robinson Group plc (“HRG”).
dnata continued to lay the foundations for
future growth by investing AED 1.2bn in new
facilities and equipment, acquisitions and
leading-edge technologies.

96

Acquisitions
In the financial year 2018-19, dnata expanded
its presence through acquisitions primarily
in inflight catering and travel businesses,
and reached new markets and customers in
Australia, the US, Europe and the UAE.
In Australia, our inflight catering business grew
after the 100% acquisition of the catering
business of Qantas Airways comprising of
Qantas Catering Group Limited (‘Q catering’)
and Snap Fresh Pty Limited (‘Snap Fresh’)together ‘Qantas Catering’. Q catering has
centres in four Australian ports – Sydney,
Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, with its
largest airline customer being Qantas. Under
the agreement, dnata will supply catering
to Qantas flights for an initial period of ten
years. Snap Fresh operates an off-airport food
development, production and preparation
facility, which caters to a wide range of
industries. In the US, we acquired a majority
stake in 121 Group International LLC (‘121
Inflight Catering’), an inflight catering business
servicing commercial airlines and private jets.
In our travel business, we increased our share
in the European market through acquisitions
in Germany; 100% stake was acquired in
Tropo GmbH (‘Tropo’) and 73% in BD4 Travel
Limited (‘BD4travel’). Tropo is a tour and travel

operator and BD4travel is an award-winning
technology company that provides artificial
intelligence (AI) driven IT solutions to online
travel agencies.
In our UAE airport operations, we acquired a
70% stake in Dubz Holding Limited (‘DUBZ’),
a group which specialises in home and hotel
check-in services for airline passengers in
Dubai. We also increased our stake in Bolloré
Logistics LLC, one of the country’s largest
logistic solutions providers, and became sole
owners of Dubai Express LLC and Freightworks
Logistics LLC. They are Dubai-based
international multimodal freight forwarders,
logistics and supply chain providers.
In our international airport operations we
increased our stake in Airport Handling SpA, a
Milan based ground handler, from 30% to 70%.

Profitability
Profit attributable to the Owner stood at AED
1.4bn (2017-18: AED 1.3bn) and cash assets
increased to highest-ever AED 5.1bn (2017-18:
AED 4.9bn). The financial year 2018-19 also
saw the completion of divestment of our
minority stake in HRG. The gain recorded
on this disposal, amounting to AED 321m, is
included within ‘other operating income’.

Our continued focus on quality, safety, people,
and customers reaped benefits this year. We
continued to drive efficiencies across all our
businesses in costs, processes and resources.
However, these gains were diminished by
one-time charges recognised in relation to
impairments in Plafond, our Dubai based fitout company, and legal claims in the US.
Our operating profit margin was almost
consistent at 8.9% (2017-18: 9.1%) and our
profit margin closed at 10.0% (2017-18:
10.1%).
The return on shareholder’s funds remained
healthy at 19.2% (2017-18: 19.3%).

Total revenue (including other
operating income)
dnata’s total revenue grew strongly by 10.3% to
AED 14.4bn (2017-18: AED 13.1bn).
Revenue from all major lines of business set
new records. The highest growth of 22.6% or
AED 0.5bn was achieved by our inflight catering
business, chiefly as a result of acquisitions made
during the year.
Overall, the share of geographic revenue
from operations outside the UAE continues to
grow and stands at 70% (2017-18: 68%). This
is consistent with dnata’s strategy to grow its
international businesses in a sustainable manner.

International airport operations continues
to be the largest business segment of dnata
by revenue. As a result of organic growth,
this business showed a 5.1% improvement
in revenue to AED 4.0bn (2017-18: AED
3.8bn). The quality of service and high safety
standards helped us win new contracts
and retain existing customers. We also
commenced services in more airports and
invested in new facilities.
This year we inked over 115 contracts with
new or existing customers in important
markets. New ground handling services
were launched at Los Angeles airport in
the US - our 83rd ground handling station.
Cargo handling operations expanded to
Belgium by the opening of a new 14,000 m2
cargo centre at Brussels airport. Additional
investments were made at London Gatwick
and Manchester airports to cater to our
customers’ demand. New contracts won this
year and in the last half of 2017-18, boosted
revenues in the US, Brazil, Italy and the UK.
This year, the Australian Dollar and Brazilian
Real weakened against the UAE Dirham and
had an unfavourable impact on revenue.

We also completed 25 years at our 1st
overseas operation, Gerry’s dnata in
Pakistan. Growth in terms of aircraft
handled was 8.8% to 488,225 (2017-18:
448,553) whilst cargo tonnage handled was
marginally up at 2,364 thousand tonnes
(2017-18: 2,352 thousand tonnes).

Travel services
Travel services revenue forms 27% (201718: 26%) of dnata’s revenue which increased
by 8.7% to AED 3.7bn (2017-18: AED
3.4bn). This was driven by growth in trading
volumes in our UK businesses. Holiday
package sales, operating under the brand
name of Emirates Holidays, witnessed
a sharp uplift. The acquisitions made in
Germany this year, namely Tropo and
BD4travel, and Destination Asia - acquired
last year, helped increase revenue by 3.3%.
The underlying Travel services related
turnover measured by Total Transaction
Value (TTV) marginally increased to AED
11.5bn (2017-18: AED 11.3bn), in spite of
tough trading conditions across the UAE
and the UK. Our travel business in Europe
now accounts for 83% of dnata travel
revenue.

This year also saw our contact centre
division taking over Etihad’s Global Contact
Centre operations for a 5-year term.

UAE airport operations
UAE airport operations touched revenue
of AED 3.2bn (2017-18: AED 3.2bn). The
growth of 2.2% primarily comes from
ground handling operations at Dubai
International Airport (DXB) and as a result
of full ownership in Dubai Express and
Freightworks, previously our associate
companies. Our ‘marhaba’ offerings
continued to contribute to the growth
as they welcomed their one millionth
customer in Dubai and celebrated the 1st
anniversary of their lounge in Melbourne.
Volumes for both aircraft and cargo
handled have marginally declined from
the previous year, due to the reduction in
traffic in and out of DXB primarily relating
to Qatar.

Inflight catering
Revenue from catering activities forms
19% (2017-18: 17%) of dnata’s revenue
which accelerated by 22.6% to AED 2.6bn
(2017-18: AED 2.1bn). This was due to the

acquisitions of the catering business of
Qantas Airways which has nearly doubled
our share of the Australian inflight catering
market. Also the acquisition of 121 Inflight
Catering, a New York based inflight caterer
for VIP and commercial airlines, aided in
increasing the top line. Organic growth,
through new customers, was achieved in
the UAE, Romania and Czech Republic.
Similar to international airport operations,
the Australian Dollar’s depreciation against
the UAE Dirham negatively impacted this
year’s inflight catering revenue.
Our Australian operations also saw the
inauguration of an ultra-modern catering
facility in Canberra with an investment of
AUD 6.5m. This facility has the capacity to
produce more than 60,000 meals a month
for commercial and charter airlines.
Meals uplifted during the financial year
rose by 27.2% to 70.9m (2017-18: 55.7m),
resulting from the new businesses onboarded and stronger volumes in existing
businesses.

Expenditure
dnata’s operating costs stood at AED
13.1bn (2017-18: AED 11.9bn), an
increase of 10.6% compared to last year.
Overall, the increase in operating costs
was due to acquisitions made during the
year and organic growth in all existing
lines of business. The results were
also negatively impacted by one-time
charges recognised towards impairments
of intangible assets and trade
receivables of Plafond. Weakening of
global currencies against the US Dollar
neutralised these impacts partially.

Employee costs, which form 41%
(2017-18: 43%) of total operating costs,

Direct costs

Direct costs in Airport operations were
AED 1.4bn (2017-18: AED 1.3bn) and

12.8% higher than the previous year, at
AED 5.0bn (2017-18: AED 4.4bn).
The volume growth in our UK travel

Statement of financial position
Assets
Total assets grew by 5.6% or AED 0.8bn
to AED 15.1bn (2017-18: AED 14.3bn).
Property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’),
investment property and intangible
assets stood at AED 5.4bn (2017-18: AED
5.0bn), increasing by 8.8% due to new
acquisitions and various investments
made across all four lines of business to
support the growing operations.
The net increase in PPE of AED 0.4bn was
driven by new acquisitions in Australia,
the US, Germany and the UAE, which
increased PPE by AED 181m. We also
made significant investments in our
GSE – choosing green or hybrid options.
New GSE fleet was acquired both in the
UAE and in our international businesses,
predominantly in the US to handle new
operations in Nashville, Baltimore and
Los Angeles. Further, in January 2019,

our inflight catering division inaugurated
a new state-of-the-art kitchen facility in
Canberra, Australia to enhance service
offerings while our travel business added
a new office building in the UK.
Intangible assets of AED 3.0bn (201718: AED 2.8bn) form 49% of dnata’s
non-current assets. New acquisitions
added AED 404m to goodwill and other
intangible assets. Goodwill continues to
form the largest portion of the intangible
asset portfolio at 72% (2017-18: 74%)
which is validated on an annual basis
through impairment testing. This year,
an impairment charge of AED 78m was
taken on our investment in Plafond, as
future cash flows struggled to support
the carrying value of goodwill and
customer relationship assets in a difficult
market.
dnata continues to invest in the
latest technology to stay ahead of its
competition, making sizable additions in
cyber security, financial systems, travel

related websites and other technological
developments.
A strong US Dollar reduced the value of
PPE and intangible assets by AED 220m.
Investments accounted for using the
equity method (including those classified
as held for sale) stood at AED 503m
(2017-18: AED 519m). This drop was due
to the sale of our stake in HRG offset to
some extent by an increased stake in
Bolloré Logistics.
Inventory levels increased by 64% to
AED 143m (2017-18: AED 87m) due to
higher food and beverages related stock
in our catering businesses – largely in
Australia and the US.
Trade and other receivables, increased by
AED 98m or 2.7% to AED 3.7bn (2017-18:
AED 3.6bn), resulting from the organic
growth across all business lines, partly
offset by impairment of receivables in
Plafond.

Equity
Total equity at AED 8.0bn (2017-18: AED
7.3bn) reflects a growth of 10.2% over
the last year due to record profits for
the year. During the year, we declared a
dividend of AED 500m to the Owner.

Liabilities
Borrowings and lease liabilities increased
by 39% to AED 1.6bn (2017-18: AED
1.2bn). Term loans form almost 90% of
the total borrowings and lease liabilities.
The increase in term loans of AED 0.4bn
was due to loans taken to fund new
acquisitions, amounting to AED 613m
reduced by repayments of AED 156m. A
strong US Dollar positively impacted this
balance.
Trade and other payables stood at
AED 4.6bn (2017-18: AED 5.0bn), a
decrease of 9.1% due to the settlement
of previous year’s dividend amounting
to AED 1bn, offset by the current year
dividend payable of AED 0.5bn.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Emirates and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as “Emirates”) as at 31 March 2019, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

What we have audited
Emirates’ consolidated financial statements comprise:
● the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2019; and
● the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of
significant accounting policies.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section
of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of Emirates in accordance with the International Ethics Standards

Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”)
and the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated
financial statements in the United Arab Emirates. We have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

Our audit approach
Overview
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of
material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we
considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed
the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters
consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.
The areas, in our professional judgement, that are of most significance to the audit
(“Key audit matters”) and where we focused most audit effort during the year were:

Passenger and cargo revenue recognition

FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

When a flight booking is made, passenger and cargo revenue is measured based on the sales
price to the customer and allocated to each performance obligation under the contract. Revenue
is initially deferred on the consolidated statement of financial position and subsequently
recognised in the consolidated income statement when the related performance obligation has
been fulfilled (typically when a passenger or the cargo has flown) (refer to notes 2, 3, 5 and 29 to
the consolidated financial statements).

We performed detailed end-to-end walkthroughs of the finance
and operational processes surrounding the revenue systems,
utilising our understanding of the industry and Emirates, to
assess the design effectiveness of the related key internal controls
and identify changes, if any.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current year. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters.

INFORMATION

The determination of the amount of revenue to be recognised for each flight requires complex IT
systems and involves the exchange of information with industry systems and other airlines for a
high volume of transactions.
The accounting for passenger and cargo revenue is susceptible to management override of
controls through the recording of manual journals in the accounting records, the override of
IT systems to accelerate revenue recognition, or the manipulation of inputs used to calculate
revenue recorded in respect of unused revenue documents.
The timing of revenue recognition for unused revenue documents requires judgement due to the
timeframe over which revenue documents can be utilised and the large number of fare types sold
by Emirates. Management has determined the value of unused revenue documents that will not
be utilised based on their terms and conditions and historical expiry trends.
We focused on this area as a result of the complexity of the related IT systems, the potential
for management override of controls and the level of judgement required by management in
determining the timing of recognition of unused revenue documents.

102

We tested the operating effectiveness of these key controls
to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence that they operated
throughout the year as intended. We tested the key IT systems,
including interfaces that impact the recognition of revenue from
passenger and cargo sales along with the IT change control
procedures and related application controls.
We performed tests of details over passenger and cargo revenue
and substantively tested manual journal entries posted into
relevant revenue accounts in the sub-ledgers and general ledger.
We obtained data supporting Emirates’ historical expiry trend in
respect of unused revenue documents. In addition to performing
controls based testing as described above, we tested the accuracy
of historical expiry data and compared this data to that used
by Emirates in their calculation of the amount of revenue to
recognise from unused revenue documents.
We assessed whether the related disclosures in notes 2, 3, 5 and
29 to the consolidated financial statements are consistent with
the requirements of IFRS.

Accounting for the “Skywards” frequent flyer programme
Emirates operates a frequent flyer programme (“Skywards”) in order to encourage and
incentivise loyalty from its customers. Skywards members either earn Skywards miles after
a flight has been paid for and flown or from Skywards partners who purchase miles from
Emirates to issue to their customers. Skywards miles can be redeemed for reductions in
airfares as well as being used towards free flights, cabin class upgrades and other non-airline
rewards.
The fair value of unused miles issued to Skywards members when flights are flown, and
the consideration received for miles issued to Skywards members from sales to partners
with a total value of AED 2,009 million (2018: AED 2,243 million), is recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position as deferred revenue (refer notes 2, 3 and 26 to
the consolidated financial statements). Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income
statement when the miles are redeemed by a customer and the underlying performance
obligation relating to the redeemed miles is fulfilled.
The fair value per mile is based on a relative standalone selling price calculated using a
model incorporating a number of factors including historical sector average fares, historical
fares for upgrades, ticket and upgrade availability and redemption patterns. An estimate is
also made of the number of miles that will expire based on historical expiry patterns and
known future changes to the Skywards programme.
This is a Key audit matter because of the significant level of judgement exercised by
management in determining the underlying assumptions within the model.

Lease classification and the related lease accounting
Emirates operates aircraft under both finance and operating lease arrangements and during
the year has entered into sale and leaseback transactions on new aircraft deliveries (refer to
notes 2, 3, 19 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements).
In determining the appropriate lease classification, IAS 17 – “Leases” is applied by Emirates
and the substance of the transaction rather than just the legal form is considered. Factors
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
● whether the lease transfers ownership of the aircraft to Emirates by the end of the lease
term;
● whether Emirates has the option to purchase the aircraft at a price that is substantially
lower than the fair value on exercise date;
● whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the aircraft; and
● whether the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to substantially all of
the fair value of the leased aircraft.
Profits or losses on sale and leaseback transactions are either recognised immediately or
deferred in accordance with the finance and operating leases accounting policy set out in
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
We focused on this area because the accounting implications for leases, including the
presentation within the consolidated financial statements, are substantially different
depending on the classification determined, and because of the inherent level of
management judgement within the assessment of lease classification and accounting for
sale and leaseback transactions, together with the materiality of the related balances.

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
We tested management’s model supporting the calculation of Skywards
deferred revenue as follows:
● we understood the process and related controls by which deferred
revenue is calculated;
● we tested automated controls and key interfaces between the IT
systems used to initially accrue and subsequently redeem the Skywards
miles for each member;
● we reconciled the Skywards miles issued and redeemed during the year,
and the closing miles balance in the model to the underlying IT systems;
● we tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s model;
● we tested the key assumptions within management’s model, including
agreeing historical expiry trends supporting the expiry percentage and
agreeing historical sector average fares and historical fares for upgrades
to underlying reports, discussing anticipated future changes to the
Skywards programme that may impact expiry trends with appropriate
senior management and testing ticket and upgrade availability to
internal supporting evidence; and
● we performed a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and
variables used in management’s model.
We assessed whether the disclosures in notes 2, 3, and 26 to the
consolidated financial statements are consistent with the requirements
of IFRS.

We evaluated management’s assessment of lease classification under IFRS
to determine whether a lease is considered to be finance or operating in
nature.
We examined the lease agreements for aircraft deliveries during the year to
identify:
● whether the lease transfers ownership of the aircraft to Emirates by the
end of the lease term;
● whether Emirates has the option to purchase the aircraft at a price that is
substantially lower than the fair value on exercise date; and
● whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the
aircraft.
We undertook independent calculations to assess whether the present value
of the minimum lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value
of the leased aircraft.
In the case of sale and leaseback transactions on new aircraft resulting in an
operating lease, we compared the fair values of the aircraft to the purchase
price and recalculated the profit or loss on these transactions. We tested
whether management appropriately accounted for the profit or loss arising
from these transactions.
We assessed whether the related disclosures in notes 2, 3, 19 and 22 to the
consolidated financial statements are consistent with the requirements of IFRS.

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter

Provision for aircraft return conditions

We obtained the aircraft return provision model prepared by management, together with a
summary of the underlying assumptions.

Emirates operated 148 aircraft under operating lease arrangements
at 31 March 2019 (2018: 158).

We tested the completeness of the provision by ensuring that all significant return condition
obligations included in aircraft operating lease contracts were included in the model.

Under the terms of the operating lease arrangements with the
lessors, Emirates is contractually committed to either return the
aircraft and/or engines in a certain condition or to compensate
the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and/or
engines at the date of return. Accordingly, a provision of AED 3,187
million (2018: AED 3,336 million) for the cost associated with these
return conditions is recorded during the lease term and is included
within Provisions (refer to notes 2, 3, 23 and 25 of the consolidated
financial statements).

We reperformed the calculation to test the mathematical accuracy.

The provision is calculated using a model which incorporates a
number of assumptions, requiring significant judgement, including
the:
● past and expected future utilisation and maintenance patterns of
the aircraft and engines;
● expected cost of the maintenance at the time it is estimated to
occur; and
● discount rate applied to calculate the present value of the future
liability.
We focused on this area because of the significant level of
judgement exercised by management in determining the underlying
assumptions within the model.

To understand the methodology used by management, the following key assumptions were
discussed with senior engineering personnel:
● the past and expected future utilisation and maintenance patterns of the aircraft;
● the expected cost of each maintenance event at the time it is expected to occur; and
● the discount rate applied to calculate the present value of the future liability.
We compared historical utilisation of the aircraft to flying records and assessed if the future
utilisation assumptions were considered reasonable in light of past experience. Assumed
maintenance costs were assessed against historical actual costs incurred and existing long
term maintenance agreements. Future maintenance patterns were assessed against internal
maintenance plans. We verified that the discount rate applied by management to the future
liability was within an acceptable range with reference to the time value of money applicable to
Emirates and the risks specific to the liability.
Along with performing a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes in assumptions,
we also compared provisions held for aircraft and engines returned during the year to the
compensation paid out to the lessors or actual costs incurred to establish if past provisions were
reasonable.
We assessed whether the related disclosures in notes 2, 3, 23 and 25 to the consolidated financial
statements are consistent with the requirements of IFRS.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual Report (but does not include
the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon).
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

104

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information identified above and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and
those charged with governance for the
consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control

as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
management is responsible for assessing Emirates’ ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate Emirates or to cease operations, or
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for
overseeing Emirates’ financial reporting process.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Owner of Emirates (continued)
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current year and are therefore the Key audit matters. We describe
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
PricewaterhouseCoopers

● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Emirates’ internal control.
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
● Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on Emirates’ ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause Emirates to cease to continue as a going concern.

Registered Auditor Number 834

● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
● Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information
of the entities or business activities within Emirates to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the Emirates audit. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion.

IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 replaced IAS 18 which covered contracts for sale of goods and rendering of
services and IAS 11 which covered construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a
good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing
notion of risks and rewards. The standard provides a new five-step model that must be
applied to all contracts with customers.
Emirates applied the modified retrospective method on transition to the new standard
from 1 April 2018. Revenue from certain ancillary services such as administration fees
which were previously recognised at the time of collection are now recognised when the
related services are provided. The cumulative effect of this change was recognised on
1 April 2018 resulting in an increase in passenger and cargo sales in advance (disclosed
within trade and other payables) of AED 41m with a corresponding impact in retained
earnings. There was no other significant change to the method or timing of revenue
recognition compared to the previous year. Following the adoption of IFRS 15, Emirates
classifies the entire deferred revenue in respect of its frequent flyer programme
(‘Skywards’) as a current liability as Emirates does not control the timing of the miles
being utilised by the customer. The deferred revenue balance was previously classified as
current and non-current liabilities based on expected redemption patterns. Prior year
comparative balances have been re-presented to ensure amounts are comparable.
Not yet effective and have not been early adopted
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, certain new
accounting standards have been published that are not mandatory for the financial year
ended 31 March 2019, and have not been early adopted. The following new standard will
have an impact on Emirates and management has performed an initial estimate of its
impact.
IFRS 16, Leases (effective for Emirates from 1 April 2019)
IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet by lessees,
as the distinction between operating and finance lease is removed. Under the new
standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals
are recognised. Leases are capitalised by recognising the present value of the lease
payments and showing them either as lease assets (right-of-use assets) or together with
property, plant and equipment. An optional exemption exists (which Emirates will avail)
for short-term and low-value leases.

The standard will have a significant impact on the Emirates consolidated financial
statements considering the number of aircraft and other operating leases in its portfolio
with future minimum lease payments under operating leases at 31 March 2019
amounting to AED 75 billion (Note 22).
The consolidated statement of financial position will be impacted by the recognition of a
right-of-use asset and a lease liability related to these assets. In respect of the
consolidated income statement, there will be an impact as the total expense is typically
higher in the earlier years of a lease and lower in later years. Additionally, operating lease
charges will be replaced with interest and depreciation expense. With Emirates’ young
fleet, the application of IFRS 16 is expected to result in a higher charge in the
consolidated income statement for the year ending 31 March 2020 compared to the
expense based on IAS 17. Further, operating cash flows will be higher as cash payments
for the lease liability will be classified within financing activities. Under IFRS 16,
provisions for aircraft return conditions will form part of the right-of-use asset from
inception of the lease and will be depreciated over the lease term. The associated
provision will be recognised at present value with the associated finance cost being
charged to the consolidated income statement as a finance expense over the lease term.
Emirates will apply the modified retrospective method on transition to the new standard
from 1 April 2019 and comparatives will not be restated. Right-of-use assets will be
measured at the lease commencement date using Emirates’ incremental borrowing rates
as if the new rules had always been applied, i.e. the cumulative depreciation impact from
the lease commencement date to the date of transition will be reflected in the initial
measurement of right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities will be determined based on
Emirates’ incremental borrowing rates and rates of exchange at the date of transition
(1 April 2019) and will incorporate extension options only if considered likely based on
fleet plans.
Upon adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, Emirates’ assets and liabilities are estimated
to increase in the range of AED 50 – 54 billion and AED 58 – 62 billion respectively,
depending on the outcome of certain contracts which are in negotiation stages.
There are no other new standards, amendments or interpretations, that are either
effective or not yet effective, and would be expected to have a material impact on
Emirates.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those entities (including structured entities) over which Emirates has
control. Control is exercised when Emirates is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over that entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on
which control is transferred to Emirates and are de-consolidated from the date that
control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses
arising on transactions between Emirates and its subsidiaries are eliminated.

Basis of consolidation (continued)
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by
Emirates. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the
fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities acquired, fair value of any contingent
consideration arrangements and the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the
subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets,
including intangible assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities, if any, incurred
or assumed in a business combination, are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date.
Any non-controlling interest in the subsidiary is recognised on an acquisition-byacquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of recognised amounts of subsidiaries’ identifiable net assets.
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts
classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in
fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of
Emirates’ previously held equity interest in the subsidiary is remeasured to fair value at
the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Emirates treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of
control as transactions with the owners. A change in ownership interest results in an
adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling
interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the
amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid is
recorded in equity.
Associates are those entities in which Emirates has significant influence but not control
or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the
voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those
policies. Investments in associates are accounted for by applying the equity method and
include goodwill (net of accumulated impairment loss, if any) identified on acquisition,
after initially being recorded at cost.
Joint ventures are contractual arrangements which establish joint control and where
Emirates has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by applying the equity method and

112

include goodwill (net of accumulated impairment loss, if any) identified on acquisition,
after initially being recognised at cost.
When Emirates’ share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceed its
interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long term receivables, Emirates does
not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on
behalf of the other entity.
All material unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions between Emirates and its
associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of Emirates’ interest.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with Emirates’ accounting policies.
When Emirates ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity or business is
remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in the
carrying amount recognised in the consolidated income statement. The fair value
becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the
retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity or
business are accounted for as if the related assets or liabilities have been directly
disposed off. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement. If the
ownership in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement
where appropriate.
Revenue
Passenger (including excess baggage) and cargo sales are recognised as revenue when
each performance obligation for the transportation service is fulfilled and is presented
net of discounts. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the
relative stand-alone selling price related to each performance obligation. Revenue
documents (e.g. tickets or airway bills) sold but unused are held in the consolidated
statement of financial position under current liabilities as passenger and cargo sales in
advance. Passenger ticket related breakage is estimated based on historical trends and
recognised in the consolidated income statement proportionally with each transfer of
service to the customer.
Where Emirates acts as an agent between the service provider and the end customer,
the net commission is recognised as revenue on satisfaction of the performance
obligation (which is typically the date of sale).

Finance income and costs

Revenue (continued)

Interest income and costs are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective
interest method.

Revenues from the sale of consumer goods, food and beverages and catering operations
is recognised when the control of goods is transferred to the customer and are stated
net of discounts and returns.
All other revenues, including revenue from hotel operations, are recognised net of
discounts and taxes, when the respective performance obligations are satisfied.
Frequent flyer programme (‘Skywards’)
Emirates operates a frequent flyer programme that provides a variety of awards to
programme members based on a mileage credit for flights on Emirates and other
airlines that participate in the programme. Members can also accrue miles by utilising
the services of non-airline programme participants.
Emirates accounts for Skywards miles (predominantly accrued through sale of flight
tickets or purchase of miles by programme partners) as a separately identifiable
component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. The consideration in
respect of the initial sale allocated to Skywards miles is based on their relative standalone selling price, adjusted for expected expiry and the extent to which the demand for
an award cannot be met, and is recorded under current liabilities as ‘deferred revenue’.
The stand-alone selling price is determined based on an adjusted market assessment
approach, using estimation techniques and taking into consideration the various
redemption options available to Skywards members. Marketing income earned from
partners associated with the programme is recognised when the miles are issued.
Revenue from redemption of miles is recognised in the consolidated income statement
only when Emirates fulfils its obligations by supplying free or discounted goods or
services on redemption of the miles accrued.
Liquidated damages
Income from claims for liquidated damages on aircraft and related assets is recognised
in the consolidated income statement as other income or a reduction to operating costs
when a contractual entitlement exists, amounts can be reliably measured and receipt is
virtually certain. When such claims do not relate to compensations for loss of income or
are not towards incremental operating costs, the amounts are taken to the consolidated
statement of financial position and recorded as a reduction in the cost of the related
asset.

Foreign currency translation
Emirates’ consolidated financial statements are presented in UAE Dirham (“AED”), which
is also the company’s functional currency. Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
determine their own functional currency and items included in the financial statements
of these companies are measured using that functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The resultant foreign exchange gains and
losses, other than those on qualifying cash flow hedges deferred in other comprehensive
income, are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Where functional currencies of subsidiaries are different from AED, income,
comprehensive income and cash flow statements of subsidiaries are translated into AED
at average exchange rates for the year that approximate the cumulative effect of rates
prevailing on the transaction dates and their assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rates ruling at the end of reporting period. The resulting exchange differences
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Share of results of investments accounted for using the equity method are translated
into AED at average exchange rates for the year whereas Emirates’ share of net
investments is translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting
period. Translation differences relating to investments in associates, joint ventures and
monetary assets and liabilities that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When investments in subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or net investment in a
foreign operation are disposed of, the related translation differences previously recorded
in equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rates
prevailing at the end of reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in
other comprehensive income.

Deferred income tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, deferred income tax is not recognised if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Also, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill in a business combination.

Property, plant and equipment

EMIRATES
FINANCIAL
COMMENTARY

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment. Cost consists of the purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of
acquisition. Emirates receives credits from manufacturers in connection with the
acquisition of certain aircraft and engines. These credits are recorded as a reduction to
the cost of the related aircraft and engines.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to Emirates and the cost can be measured reliably.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment is
calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, less estimated residual
values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, if shorter.

15 - 18 years (residual value nil - 10%)
5 - 15 years (residual value nil - 10%)
15 - 40 years
3 - 20 years or over the lease term, if shorter

Major overhaul expenditure including engine restoration (presented within other
property, plant and equipment) is capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of the
period to the next major overhaul, the remaining lease term or the useful life of the asset
concerned.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at
the end of each reporting period.
Capital projects are stated at cost. When the asset is ready for its intended use, it is
transferred from capital projects to the appropriate category under property, plant and
equipment and depreciated in accordance with Emirates’ policies.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no
future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on
disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
qualifying assets are added to the cost of the assets until such time that the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use. Where funds are borrowed specifically for the
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, any investment income earned on temporary
surplus funds is deducted from borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. In the case of
general borrowings, a capitalisation rate, which is the weighted average rate of general
borrowing costs, is applied to the expenditure on qualifying assets and included in the
cost of the asset.

Finance and operating leases
Where property, plant and equipment has been financed by lease agreements under
which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to
Emirates, they are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the
commencement of the lease at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease
payments or the fair value of the leased asset. The corresponding lease obligations are
included under liabilities. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest
elements. The interest element is charged to the consolidated income statement as
finance costs over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on
the remaining balance of the liability. Property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases are depreciated in accordance with Emirates’ policies.
Leases, where a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the
lessor, are classified as operating leases. Lease rental charges, including advance rentals
in respect of operating leases, are charged to the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Gains and losses arising on sale and leaseback transactions resulting in an operating
lease and where the sale price and subsequent future lease payments are at fair value,
are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Where the sale price
is below fair value, any losses are immediately recognised in the consolidated income
statement, except where the loss is compensated for by future lease payments at below
market price, it is deferred and amortised in proportion to the lease payments over the
period for which the asset is expected to be used. Where the sale price is above fair
value, the excess over fair value is accounted for as a deferred credit and amortised over
the period for which the asset is expected to be used.
Lease classification is made at the inception of the lease. Lease classification is changed
only if, at any time during the lease, the parties to the lease agreement agree to change
the provisions of the lease (without renewing it) in a way that it would have been
classified differently at inception had the changed terms been in effect at that time. The
revised agreement is considered as a new agreement and accounted for prospectively
over the remaining term of the lease.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and the acquisition-date
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the
net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash
generating units or a group of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from
the business combination in which the goodwill arose. An impairment loss is recognised
when the carrying value of the cash generating units or a group of cash generating units
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity sold.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets are capitalised at cost only when future economic benefits are
probable. Cost includes the purchase price together with any directly attributable
expenditure.
In the case of internally developed computer software, development expenditure is
capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially
feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and there exists an intent and ability to
complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Other research and development
expenditure not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
which are:
Service rights
Trade names
Contractual rights
Computer software

15 years
20 years
15 years
3-7 years

The intangible assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting period.
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on derecognition are determined
by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the
consolidated income statement.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Emirates’ criteria to account for a derivative financial instrument as a hedge include:

Impairment of non-financial assets



the hedging relationship consists only of eligible hedging instruments and eligible
hedged items; and



at the inception of the hedging relationship there is a formal designation and
documentation of the hedging relationship, including Emirates’ risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, identification of the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how Emirates
will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness; and



there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument; and



effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that results from the
economic relationship. The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as
that resulting from the quantity of hedged item that Emirates actually hedges and
the quantity of the hedging instrument that Emirates actually uses to hedge that
quantity for hedged item.

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment. Other
non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, non-aircraft
related assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable
cash flows (cash generating units). In respect of aircraft and related assets, these assets
are assessed for impairment at the Emirates’ network level. Non-financial assets other
than goodwill are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for possible reversals of
historic impairment losses.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified in accordance with IFRS 9 as ‘Financial assets at amortised
cost’ which consists of financial assets that are debt instruments and are intended to be
held to maturity on the basis of Emirates business model. Furthermore, these
instruments have fixed payment terms and meet the criteria for cash flow characteristics
i.e. contractual payments of principal and interest. At Emirates, this category includes
trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments), short term bank deposits and cash
and cash equivalents. They are classified as non-current or current assets according to
their remaining maturity at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Derivatives are designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). Fair values are obtained from quoted
market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments, discounted cash flow models and
option pricing models as appropriate. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk are
recognised in other comprehensive income. When the forecasted transaction results in
the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are re-classified and included in
the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability. These gains and losses are ultimately
recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period during which the
asset or liability affects profit or loss. In all other cases, amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in
the period during which the forecasted transaction affects the consolidated income
statement and are presented in the same line item as the gains and losses from hedged
items.
When a cash flow hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or
when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is retained in equity and is
ultimately recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecasted
transaction occurs. If a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the
consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognised
in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Emirates utilises the simplified approach which uses lifetime expected loss allowances to
calculate impairment provisions on trade receivables. In the prior year, the impairment of
trade receivables was recognised based on the incurred loss model. Specific loss
allowances are also recognised when Emirates become aware of a customer experiencing
financial difficulty. Trade receivables are written off once management has determined
that such amount will not be recovered.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost with any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value recognised in the
consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method.
Provisions

service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to the pension fund are charged
to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they fall due.
A defined benefit plan is a plan which is not a defined contribution plan. The liability
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for a defined benefit plan
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period
less the fair value of plan assets at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting
estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the end of the reporting period of
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in currency in which the benefits will
be paid and have terms approximating to the estimated term of the retirement benefit
obligations.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience
adjustments are recognised in equity through the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities

Provisions are recognised when Emirates has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows
expire or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred along with
the contractual rights to receive cash flows. Financial liabilities are derecognised only
when they are extinguished i.e. when the obligations specified in the contract are
discharged or cancelled or expire.

Provision for aircraft return conditions

Cash and cash equivalents

Provision for aircraft return conditions represents the estimate of the cost to meet the
contractual lease end obligations on certain aircraft and engines held under operating
leases. The present value of the expected cost is recognised over the lease term
considering the existing fleet plan and long-term maintenance schedules.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and liquid funds with an original maturity of
three months or less. Other bank deposits with maturities of less than one year are
classified as short term bank deposits. Bank overdrafts are shown within current
borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Retirement benefit obligations

Segment reporting

Emirates operates or participates in various end of service benefit plans, which are
classified either as defined contribution or defined benefit plans.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker is
considered to be the Emirates’ leadership team who make strategic decisions and are
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating
segments.

A defined contribution plan is a pension scheme under which Emirates pays fixed
contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if
the fund does not hold sufficient assets to settle the benefits relating to the employees’

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the
consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis
or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right
must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course
of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to equity holders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, a number of estimates and
associated assumptions have been made relating to the application of accounting
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. The estimates
and associated assumptions are assessed on an ongoing basis and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following narrative addresses
the accounting policies that require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result
of the need to make estimates.
Passenger and cargo revenue recognition
Passenger and cargo sales are recognised as revenue when each performance obligation
for the transportation service is fulfilled. The value of unused revenue documents is held
in the consolidated statement of financial position under current liabilities as passenger
and cargo sales in advance. Passenger ticket related breakage is estimated based on
historical trends and recognised in the consolidated income statement proportionally
with each transfer of service to the customer. A 5% change to the breakage percentage
will not result in a material change to passenger and cargo revenue.
Frequent flyer programme (‘Skywards’)
Emirates accounts for Skywards miles (predominantly accrued through sale of flight
tickets or purchase of miles by programme partners) as a separately identifiable
component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. The consideration in
respect of the initial sale allocated to Skywards miles is based on their stand-alone value
and is recorded under current liabilities as ‘deferred revenue’ (Note 26).

118

The stand-alone selling price is determined using the adjusted market assessment
approach. This approach involves estimation techniques to determine the stand-alone
value of Skywards miles and reflect the weighted average of a number of factors i.e. fare
per sector, flight upgrades and partner rewards based on historical trends. Adjustments
to the stand-alone selling price of miles are also made for miles not expected to be
redeemed by members and the extent to which the demand for an award cannot be
met.
A level of judgement is exercised by management due to the diversity of inputs that go
into determining the stand-alone selling price of miles. A reasonably possible change to
any single assumption will not result in a material change to the deferred revenue.
Useful lives and residual values of aircraft and related assets
Management assigns useful lives and residual values to aircraft and related assets based
on the intended use and the economic lives of those assets. Subsequent changes in
circumstances such as technological advances or prospective utilisation of the assets
concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial
estimates.
Aircraft finance and operating lease classification
A lease is classified as a finance lease when substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an aircraft are transferred to Emirates. In determining the appropriate lease
classification, the substance of the transaction rather than the legal form is considered.
Factors considered include but are not limited to the following: whether the lease
transfers ownership of the aircraft to Emirates by the end of the lease term; Emirates has
the option to purchase the aircraft at a price that is sufficiently lower than the fair value
on exercise date; the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the aircraft
and the present value of the minimum lease payments amount to at least substantially
all of the fair value of the leased aircraft.
Provision for aircraft return conditions
The measurement of the provision for aircraft return conditions includes assumptions
relating to expected costs, escalation rates, discount rates commensurate with the
expected obligation maturity and long-term maintenance schedules. An estimate is
therefore made at each reporting date to ensure that the provision corresponds to the
present value of the expected costs to be borne by Emirates. A significant level of
judgement is exercised by management given the long-term nature and diversity of
assumptions that go into the determination of the provision. A reasonably possible
change in any single assumption will not result in a material change to the provision.

4. Fair value estimation

Valuation of defined benefit obligations

The levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis
using various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These
assumptions include the determination of the discount rate and expected salary
increases which are reviewed at each reporting date. Due to the complexities involved in
the valuation and its long-term nature, defined benefit obligations are sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. A sensitivity analysis of changes in defined benefit
obligations due to a reasonably possible change in these assumptions is set out in Note
24.

Level 1:
Level 2:
Level 3:

Measurement is made by using quoted prices (unadjusted) from an active
market.
Measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters
derived directly or indirectly from observable market data.
Measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters not
based exclusively on observable market data.

Derivatives are the only financial instruments which are carried at fair value and fall into
level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (Note 34).
Derivatives comprise forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The forward
exchange contracts have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted
in an active market. Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates
extracted from observable yield curves.

Computer software includes an amount of AED 291 m (2018: AED 212 m) in respect of projects under implementation.
For the purpose of testing goodwill impairment, the recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been determined on the basis of

value-in-use calculations using cash flow forecasts approved by management covering a three year period. Cash flows beyond the three

year period have been extrapolated using long term terminal growth rates. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
include a risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 12% (2018: 12%), gross margins consistent with historical trends and growth rates based

on management's expectations for market development. The long term terminal growth rate of 2% (2018: 2%) does not exceed the long
term average growth rate for the markets in which the cash generating units operate. Any reasonably possible change to the assumptions
will not lead to an impairment charge. The goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit or groups of cash generating units is as follows:

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of dnata and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as “dnata”) as at 31 March 2019, and its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

What we have audited

DNATA
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

● the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2019;

ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION

dnata’s consolidated financial statements comprise:
● the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 March 2019;
● the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2019; and
● the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of
significant accounting policies.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section
of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of dnata in accordance with the International Ethics Standards
Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”)
and the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated

financial statements in the United Arab Emirates. We have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

Our audit approach
Overview
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of
material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we
considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed
the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters
consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.
The areas that in our professional judgement, is of most significance to the audit (‘Key
audit matters’) and where we focused most audit effort during the year were:
Key audit matters

● Impairment of goodwill
● Acquisition of Qantas Catering

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to
provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into
account the structure of dnata, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry
in which dnata operates.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current year.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter

OVERVIEW

Impairment of goodwill

EMIRATES

As at 31 March 2019, the carrying value of goodwill was AED 2,200 million (2018: AED 2,065
million). Refer to notes 2, 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

DNATA
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” is
required to be tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount of dnata’s cash generating units or group of cash generating units to
which goodwill is allocated is determined as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and
value in use. The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the cash generating
unit or group of cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated in order to assess whether
an impairment exists. The value in use is determined by calculating the discounted cash flows of
each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units.
The calculation of value in use incorporates key assumptions including expected revenue growth
rates, profit margins, long term growth rates and discount rates.
The impairment model prepared by management in respect of one cash generating unit
containing goodwill determined that an impairment of AED 66 million was required which was
recorded by management in the consolidated financial statements.
The remaining impairment models prepared by management determined that adequate headroom
existed not to result in the need for an impairment charge in reasonably possible scenarios.
We focused on this area because the determination of whether an impairment loss should be
recognised is inherently complex and required management to exercise judgement over the
calculation of value in use.

Key audit matter
Acquisition of Qantas Catering
On 31 October 2018, dnata through its wholly owned subsidiary Alpha Flight Services Pty Ltd,
Australia, acquired 100% ownership of Qantas Catering Group Ltd and Snap Fresh Pty Ltd,
together forming the Qantas Catering business. Refer to note 33 to the consolidated financial
statements.
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ requires dnata to recognise the identifiable assets and liabilities
at fair value at the date of the acquisition, with the excess of the purchase consideration over
the identified fair values recognised as goodwill.
The fair value of land was determined using a market approach by management’s external
expert.
Other items of property, plant and equipment were valued using depreciated historic
replacement costs or management’s estimates of fair value.
Customer relationships were valued using the income approach (excess earnings) by
management’s external expert. Key assumptions under the income approach for valuing
customer relationships include projections of customer revenue and attrition rates, forecast
profit margins, discount rates and useful economic life.
Other identifiable assets and liabilities were valued by management and no significant
judgement was required.
We focused on this area because the accounting treatment for the provisional acquisition date
balance sheet is inherently complex and required management to exercise judgements over the
valuation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the completeness of liabilities
and the calculation of the associated goodwill of AED 193 million.

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
We obtained an understanding of management’s impairment models and key assumptions. We
then tested these impairment models, in particular, with regard to the appropriateness of the key
assumptions used within the models, as follows:
● we utilised our internal valuation specialists to perform independent calculations of the
discount rates, with particular reference to comparable companies and compared this to the
discount rates used by management;
● we agreed the base cash flows used in management’s impairment models to formally
approved budgets;
● we compared future expected revenue growth rates and profit margins used in the formally
approved budgets and beyond the period of the formally approved budgets to historical
trends and reviewed whether management’s estimates made in prior periods were reasonable
compared to actual performance;
● we compared the long term growth rates to external sources of information including
economic forecasts;
● we performed a sensitivity analysis over each of the significant assumptions within the value in
use calculations and considered the appropriateness of the impairment charge recognised; and
● we tested the mathematical accuracy of the model.
We assessed whether the related disclosures in notes 2, 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial
statements are consistent with the requirements of IFRS.

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
For the valuation of land performed by management’s external expert, we obtained and tested
supporting documentation and assessed whether the expert was independent, capable and
competent.
For the valuation of other items of property, plant and equipment we agreed that the
depreciated historic replacement cost and management’s estimates of fair value were
reasonable with reference to comparable assets.
For the valuation of customer relationships we validated the assumptions underlying the
calculation of the fair value by management’s external expert. In particular:
● we assessed if the income approach (excess earnings) valuation methodology is an
acceptable valuation practice;
● we compared the revenue projections, attrition rates and profit margins applied to existing
customer contracts to historical trends;
● we obtained the inputs used to calculate the discount rate and assessed them by using our
specialists to draw comparisons with a selection of comparable companies; and
● we compared the useful economic life of the customer relationships to those used in
comparable companies.
We assessed the completeness of management’s list of liabilities recognised using our
knowledge of the business, industry, audit procedures performed post acquisition, enquiries of
senior management and reading the Share Sale Agreement.
We traced the purchase consideration to supporting documents and recomputed the value of
goodwill recognised as the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair value of
the net assets acquired.
We assessed whether the related disclosures in notes 2, 3 and 33 to the consolidated financial
statements are consistent with the requirements of IFRS.

ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information included in the Annual Report (but does not include the consolidated
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon).
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility
is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report
in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with
governance for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for
assessing dnata’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
management either intends to liquidate dnata or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing dnata’s financial reporting
process.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.
● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of dnata’s internal control.
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
● Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on dnata’s ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause dnata to cease to
continue as a going concern.

● Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within dnata to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the dnata audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies, which have been applied consistently
in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee
(IFRS IC) pronouncements. The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the
historical cost convention, except for those financial assets and financial liabilities that
are measured at fair value as stated in the accounting policies.
All amounts are presented in millions of UAE Dirham (“AED m”).

156

New standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations that are
relevant to dnata
Effective and adopted in the current year
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, certain new
standards or amendments to the existing standards were effective for the current
financial year and have been adopted by dnata. These are as follows:
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39. The new standard addresses the classification, measurement and
derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces a new impairment
model for financial assets and also new rules for hedge accounting.
dnata adopted IFRS 9 from 1 April 2018. dnata’s financial assets comprising trade and
other receivables (excluding prepayments and advance lease rentals), short term bank
deposits and cash and cash equivalents were previously classified as ‘Loans and
receivables’ and were measured at amortised cost under IAS 39. dnata has assessed that
these financial assets meet the conditions for classification and measurement at
amortised cost under IFRS 9. Accordingly there is no impact on the measurement of
dnata’s financial assets, while the classification of these assets changes from ‘Loans and
receivables’ to ‘Financial assets at amortised cost’.
There is no material impact on dnata’s financial liabilities as the new requirements only
affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through
profit or loss and dnata does not have such liabilities of significant value.
The new impairment model under IFRS 9 requires the recognition of impairment
provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses
as is the case under IAS 39. It applies to trade receivables and other financial assets. For
financial assets comprising of trade receivables, dnata adopted the simplified approach
allowed under IFRS 9, under which lifetime expected loss allowance is estimated to
calculate provision. For all other financial assets, dnata follows the 12-month expected
credit loss model to calculate the impairment provision. Resulting from this change,
dnata recognised an additional impairment provision of AED 9 m in trade receivables
and AED 5 m in an investment in a joint venture with a corresponding impact in retained
earnings as at 1 April 2018.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

IFRS 16, Leases (effective from 1 January 2019)

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (continued)

IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet by lessees,
as the distinction between operating and finance lease is removed. Under the new
standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals
are recognised. Leases are capitalised by recognising the present value of the lease
payments and showing them either as lease assets (right-of-use assets) or together with
property, plant and equipment. An optional exemption exists (which dnata will avail) for
short-term and low-value leases.

IFRS 9 has substantially reformed the existing hedge accounting rules. It provides a more
principles-based approach that aligns hedge accounting closely with risk management
policies. Currency forwards in place as at 1 April 2018 qualified as cash flow hedges,
dnata risk management strategies and hedge documentation are aligned with the
requirements of IFRS 9 and these relationships are therefore treated as continuing
hedges. Accordingly, there is no material impact on dnata’s hedge accounting on
adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 replaced IAS 18 which covered contracts for sale of goods and rendering of
services and IAS 11 which covered construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a
good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing
notion of risks and rewards. The standard provides a new five-step model that must be
applied to all contracts with customers.
dnata applied the modified retrospective method on transition to the new standard from
1 April 2018.
dnata’s revenue recognition policy on adoption of IFRS 15 changed with respect to sale
of travel packages where dnata acts as a principal. IFRS 15 requires that the total
consideration received is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on a
relative stand-alone selling price and revenue should be recognised on satisfaction of
each performance obligation within a single contract with the customer. Since the
change did not result in a material impact on dnata’s consolidated financial position at
the transition date, no adjustment has been made to retained earnings as at 1 April
2018. There is no further significant change to the method or timing of revenue
recognition compared to the previous year.
Not yet effective and have not been early adopted
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, certain new
accounting standards have been published that are not mandatory for the financial year
ended 31 March 2019, and have not been early adopted. The following new standard will
have an impact on dnata’s consolidated financial position and management has
performed an initial estimate of its impact.

The standard will have a significant impact on dnata’s consolidated financial statements
considering the number of operating leases in its portfolio with future minimum lease
payments under operating leases at 31 March 2019 amounting to AED 2.4 billion (Note
25).
The consolidated statement of financial position will be impacted by the recognition of a
right-of-use asset and a lease liability related to these assets. In respect of the
consolidated income statement, there will be an impact as the total expense is typically
higher in the earlier years of a lease and lower in later years. Additionally, operating lease
charges will be replaced with interest and depreciation expense. Further, operating cash
flows will be higher as cash payments for the lease liability will be classified within
financing activities.
dnata will apply the modified retrospective method on transition to the new standard
from 1 April 2019 and comparatives will not be restated. Right-of-use assets will be
measured at the commencement date using dnata’s incremental borrowing rates as if
the new rules had always been applied, i.e. the cumulative depreciation impact from the
lease commencement date to the date of transition will be reflected in the transition
date measurement of right-of-use-asset. Lease liabilities will be determined based on
dnata’s incremental borrowing rates and rates of exchange at the date of transition (1
April 2019).
Upon adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, dnata’s assets and liabilities are estimated to
increase in the range of AED 1.5 - 1.8 billion and AED 1.7 - 2.0 billion respectively,
depending on the outcome of certain contracts which are in negotiation stages.
There are no other new standards, amendments or interpretations that are either
effective or not yet effective, and would be expected to have a material impact on dnata.

DNATA
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those entities over which dnata has control. Control is exercised when
dnata is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that entity. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to dnata and are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. Inter-company transactions,
balances and unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions between dnata and its
subsidiaries are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by
dnata. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair
value of the assets transferred, liabilities acquired, fair value of any contingent
consideration arrangements and the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the
subsidiary.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets, including
intangible assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities, if any, incurred or
assumed in a business combination, are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date. Any non-controlling interest in the subsidiary is recognised on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of recognised amounts of subsidiaries’ identifiable net assets.
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts
classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in
fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of
dnata’s previously held equity interest in the subsidiary is remeasured at fair value at the
acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in
the consolidated income statement.
dnata treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of
control as transactions with the owners. A change in ownership interest results in an
adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling
interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between
amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid is
recorded in equity.

158

Associates are those entities in which dnata has significant influence but not control or
joint control generally accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the
voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those
policies. Investments in associates are accounted for by applying the equity method and
include goodwill (net of accumulated impairment loss, if any) identified on acquisition
after initially being recorded at cost.
Joint ventures are contractual arrangements which establish joint control and where
dnata has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by applying the equity method and
include goodwill (net of accumulated impairment loss, if any) identified on acquisition
after initially being recognised at cost.
When dnata’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceed its
interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long term receivables, dnata does
not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on
behalf of the other entity.
All material unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions between dnata and its
associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of dnata’s interest.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with dnata’s accounting policies.
When dnata ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity or business is
remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in the
carrying amount recognised in the consolidated income statement. The fair value
becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the
retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity or
business are accounted for as if the related assets or liabilities have been directly
disposed off. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement. If the
ownership in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement
where appropriate.

Revenue
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and
represents amounts receivable for goods supplied or services provided, stated net of
discounts, returns and value added tax.
Revenue from airport operations which includes ground handling and cargo services is
recognised on the performance of the related service.
Revenue from travel services includes the sale of travel holiday packages and also travel
individual component bookings. Where dnata acts as principal in the arrangement, the
total consideration received is treated as revenue and allocated to separate performance
obligations based on relative stand-alone selling prices. The allocated revenue from such
contracts is recognised on satisfaction of each performance obligation within a single
contract with the customer. Where dnata acts as an agent between the service provider
and the end customer, net commission is recognised as revenue on satisfaction of the
performance obligation, i.e., on confirmation of the travel booking taking place.

Where functional currencies of subsidiaries are different from AED, income, other
comprehensive income and cash flow statements of subsidiaries are translated into AED
at average exchange rates for the year that approximate the cumulative effect of rates
prevailing on the transaction dates and their assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rates ruling at the end of reporting period. The resulting exchange differences
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Share of results and share of movement in other comprehensive income of investments
accounted for using the equity method are translated into AED at average exchange
rates for the year whereas dnata’s share of net investments is translated at the exchange
rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Translation differences relating to
investments in associates, joint ventures and monetary assets and liabilities that form
part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive
income. When investments in subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or net investment in
a foreign operation are disposed of, the related translation differences previously
recorded in equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the
gain or loss on disposal.

Revenue from the sale of goods (including in-flight catering) is recognised when the
control of goods is transferred to the customer.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rates
prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Finance income and costs

Property, plant and equipment

Interest income and costs are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective
interest method.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment. Cost consists of the purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of
acquisition.

Foreign currency translation
dnata’s consolidated financial statements are presented in UAE Dirham (“AED”), which is
also the company’s functional currency. Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
determine their own functional currency and items included in the financial statements
of these companies are measured using that functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, at the exchange
rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The resultant foreign exchange gains and
losses, other than those on qualifying net investment hedges and net investment in
foreign operations which are deferred in other comprehensive income, are recognised in
the consolidated income statement.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the items will flow to dnata and the cost can be measured reliably.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment is
calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost, less estimated residual
values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, if shorter. The
estimated useful lives are:
Buildings
Leasehold property
Plant and machinery
Office equipment and furniture
Motor vehicles

15 - 33 years
shorter of useful life or lease term
4 - 15 years

Goodwill

Property, plant and equipment (continued)

The goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred,
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and the acquisition-date
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the
net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at
the end of each reporting period.
Capital projects are stated at cost. When the asset is ready for its intended use, it is
transferred from capital projects to the appropriate category under property, plant and
equipment and depreciated in accordance with dnata’s policies.

INFORMATION

Property held for long term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and not
occupied by dnata, is classified as investment property.
Investment property comprises land and buildings. Investment property is measured
initially at its cost, including related transaction costs. The carrying amount of an
investment property includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment
property when incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes cost of day-today servicing.
Investment property (continued)
Capital projects relate to buildings under construction and are stated at cost. When the
asset is ready for its intended use, it is transferred from capital projects to buildings and
depreciated in accordance with dnata’s policies.
Investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is not
depreciated. Depreciation on buildings is charged on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful life of 20 years.
The assets’ useful life is reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.
An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on disposal
are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in
the consolidated income statement.

160

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash
generating unit or group of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the
business combination in which the goodwill arose. An impairment loss is recognised
when the carrying value of the cash generating unit or group of cash generating units
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity sold.
Other intangible assets
Computer software is capitalised at cost only when future economic benefits are
probable. Cost includes purchase price together with any directly attributable
expenditure.
In the case of internally developed computer software, development expenditure is
capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially
feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and there exists an intent and ability to
complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Other research and development
expenditure not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as incurred.
Trade names, customer relationships and contractual rights acquired in a business
combination are recognised at fair values on acquisition date. Contractual rights also
include licenses to operate in certain airports.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
which are:
Computer software
Trade names
Customer relationships
Contractual rights

3 - 7 years
10 years
3 - 15 years

Other intangible assets (continued)
The intangible assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting period.
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses on derecognition are determined
by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the
consolidated income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment. Other nonfinancial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, these assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash
generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed at the end of
each reporting period for possible reversals of historic impairment losses.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified in accordance with IFRS 9 as ‘Financial assets at amortised
cost’ which consists of financial assets that are debt instruments and are intended to be
held to maturity on the basis of dnata’s business model. Furthermore, these instruments
have fixed payment terms and meet the criteria for cash flow characteristics i.e.
contractual payments of principal and interest. This category includes trade and other
receivables (excluding prepayments and advance lease rentals), short term bank deposits
and cash and cash equivalents. They are classified as non-current or current assets
according to their remaining maturity at balance sheet date.
Finance and operating leases
Where property, plant and equipment has been financed by lease agreements under
which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to
dnata, they are classified as finance leases.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset. The
corresponding lease obligations are included under liabilities. Lease payments are
treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest element is charged to
the consolidated income statement as finance costs over the lease term so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Property,
plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance with
dnata’s policies.
Leases, where a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the
lessor are classified as operating leases. Lease rental charges, including advance rentals
in respect of operating leases, are charged to the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost is
determined on the weighted average cost basis except for food and beverage inventory
which is determined on a first-in-first-out basis.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment. dnata
utilises the simplified approach which uses lifetime expected loss allowances to calculate
impairment provision on trade receivables. In the prior year, the impairment of trade
receivables was recognised based on the incurred loss model. Specific loss allowances
are also recognised when dnata become aware of a customer experiencing financial
difficulty. Trade receivables are written off once management has determined that such
amount will not be recovered.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise all cash and liquid funds with an original maturity of
three months or less. Other bank deposits with maturities of less than a year are
classified as short term bank deposits. Bank overdrafts are shown within current
borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost with any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value recognised in the
consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when dnata has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the
present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to
the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as an
interest expense.
Retirement benefit obligations
dnata operates or participates in various end of service benefit plans, which are classified
either as defined contribution or defined benefit plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension scheme under which dnata pays fixed
contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if
the fund does not hold sufficient assets to settle the benefits relating to the employees
service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to the pension fund are charged
to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they fall due.
A defined benefit plan is a plan which is not a defined contribution plan. The liability
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for a defined benefit plan
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period
less the fair value of plan assets at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting
estimated future cash outflows using market yields of high quality corporate bonds at
the end of the reporting period that are denominated in currency in which the benefits
will be paid and have terms approximating to the estimated term of the postemployment benefit obligations.

162

Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience
adjustments are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income in the period
in which they arise.
Income tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where dnata’s
subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on temporary
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable income. Also deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred income
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted in the jurisdiction of the individual companies by the end of the reporting
period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled
or the deferred income tax asset is realised.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by dnata and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when
the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

INFORMATION

Dividend distribution to equity holders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated

at the inception of the hedging relationship there is a formal designation and
documentation of the hedging relationship, including dnata risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, identification of the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how dnata will
assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness; and



there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument;



effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that results from the
economic relationship. The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as
that resulting from the quantity of hedged item that dnata actually hedges and the
quantity of the hedging instrument that dnata actually uses to hedge that quantity
for hedged item.

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated
statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows
expire or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred along with
the contractual rights to receive cash flows. Financial liabilities are derecognised only
when they are extinguished i.e. when the obligations specified in the contract are
discharged or cancelled or expire.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Derivatives are designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). Fair values are obtained from quoted
market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments, discounted cash flow models and
option pricing models as appropriate. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk are
recognised in other comprehensive income. When the forecasted transaction results in
the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are re-classified and included in
the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability. These gains and losses are ultimately
recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period during which the
asset or liability affects profit or loss. In all other cases, amounts previously recognised
in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in
the period during which the forecasted transaction affects the consolidated income
statement and are presented in the same line item as the gains and losses from hedged
items.
When a cash flow hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or
when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is retained in equity and is
ultimately recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecasted
transaction occurs. If a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to
the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion is
immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements

4. Fair value estimation

In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, a number of estimates and
associated assumptions have been made relating to the application of accounting
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are assessed on an ongoing basis and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following narrative addresses
the accounting policies that require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result
of the need to make estimates.

The levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Valuation of intangible assets on acquisition
For each acquisition, management assesses the fair value of intangible assets acquired.
Where an active market does not exist to value an intangible asset, fair values are
established using established valuation techniques that use estimates of future cash
flows and the useful life related to the asset based on management’s experience and
expectation at the time of acquisition. Discount rates applied to future cash flows are
also subject to judgement. Disclosure of the significant acquisitions undertaken by dnata
is given in Note 33 to these consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of
the cash generating units or group of cash generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash
flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and use a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate present value. The estimates made in arriving at the value-in-use
calculation and associated sensitivities are set out in Note 10.
Valuation of defined benefit obligations
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis
using various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These
assumptions include the determination of the discount rate and expected salary
increases which are reviewed at each reporting date. Due to the complexities involved in
the valuation and its long-term nature, defined benefit obligations are highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. A sensitivity analysis of changes in defined benefit
obligations due to a reasonably possible change in these assumptions are set out in
Note 19.

164

Level 1:
Level 2:
Level 3:

Measurement is made by using quoted prices (unadjusted) from the active
market.
Measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters
derived directly or indirectly from observable market data.
Measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters not
based exclusively on observable market data.

Derivatives, contingent consideration and option liabilities are carried at fair value.
Derivatives fall into level 2 of the fair value hierarchy whereas contingent consideration
and option liabilities fall into level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives comprise forward exchange contracts. The forward exchange contracts are
fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market.
The fair values of contingent consideration and option liabilities are determined by using
valuation techniques based on entity specific estimates. These estimates are not based
on observable market data and hence classified under level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The changes in the fair value of level 3 instruments are set out in Note 17.

Investment property includes an amount of AED 20 m (2018: Nil) in respect of projects under construction.
Investment property is pledged as security against term loans (Note 22).
Investment property comprises rental property in Dubai. The fair value of investment property as at 31 March 2019 is AED 455 m (2018:

AED 461 m), which was determined based on internal valuations as there is no active market for such properties. The fair value has

been computed by discounting the contractual future lease rental income at a discount rate of 6% (2018: 6%) commensurate to the
borrowing rate. These estimates are not based on observable market data and hence classified under level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Revenue from rental income earned during the year amounting to AED 31 m (2018: AED 23 m) is recognised in the consolidated
income statement as revenue from 'Services-Others'.
